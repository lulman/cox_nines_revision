1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.150
I've prepared a little string

2
00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:07.480
with the slipknot in the end here,

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.310
which I will . . .

4
00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.440
I'm going to tie it through these areas

5
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:19.100


6
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.100
where I've made 

7
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:31.105
the back cornering impressions there.

8
00:00:31.125 --> 00:00:41.105


9
00:00:41.125 --> 00:00:51.105


10
00:00:51.125 --> 00:01:01.105


11
00:01:01.125 --> 00:01:05.060


12
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.860
[Videographer}: One of the reasons

13
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.860
I wanted to move a little closer

14
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.730
is because when you are working

15
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.860
with the string it had a real nice pop

16
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:20.855
when you tighten it-it's satisfying.

17
00:01:20.875 --> 00:01:22.360


18
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.900
[Harry Campbell]: That's good. 

19
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.980
That's going to hold things

20
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.100
in shape while I do, while I do some . . .

21
00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:44.105
sort of refining of 
the shape of these head caps.

22
00:01:44.125 --> 00:01:54.105


23
00:01:54.125 --> 00:01:57.480


24
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:04.940
Okay.

25
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.770
First I'm going to push back

26
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:14.520
that way, and that way, 

27
00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:22.230
widen that a little bit,

28
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.600
and then flatten this head cap

29
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.730
a little bit, which again you start to see 

30
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.770
a real traditional sort of look of a leather binding.

31
00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:43.650
With a little book like this it doesn't take much.

32
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.440
Same thing here. 

33
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:57.438
Push that out a little. This way, that way.

34
00:02:57.458 --> 00:03:00.600


35
00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.900
Flatten it out like so.

36
00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:04.900
And I think at this point

37
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.440
I'll just get rid of this string

38
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:16.438
'cause it's . . . again, it's a very. . . .

39
00:03:16.458 --> 00:03:19.900


40
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.150
I might want to work on those areas.

41
00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.190
No, actually that looks pretty good.

42
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:35.188
I think I might just leave it.

43
00:03:35.208 --> 00:03:44.150


44
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.900
That looks good. Okay. 

45
00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.230
Now, the only part that is adhered 
so far is right. . . .

46
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.900
I haven't put the cloth joints or the sewing slips

47
00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.150
down or anything, and I won't do that right now.

48
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:00.980
What I'm going to do is just rub this spine 

49
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.860
down one more time, make sure it's in contact,

50
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:16.855
and then the. . . . 

51
00:04:16.875 --> 00:04:20.860


52
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.560
I'll do it right here

53
00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.940
so you can see what I'm doing.

54
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.270
I would normally just do this 
over the edge here 

55
00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:38.230
I will just slide it out here. Okay.

56
00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:48.230


57
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:58.230


58
00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:08.230


59
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:18.230


60
00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:28.230


61
00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:37.060


62
00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:42.900
I'll square up these edges just a little bit.

63
00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.440
Again, the leather is still wet, you know, 

64
00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.900
and the paste is still wet, 

65
00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:55.897
and it's all very moldable at this point. 

66
00:05:55.917 --> 00:06:00.150


67
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.900
It's starting to dry out. 

68
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:05.270
You can see the color coming back. 

69
00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:07.600
But, you know, if you touch it,

70
00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:14.600
it is cold and damp.

71
00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.860
And at this point, I'm ready to then just... 

72
00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.730
I'll insert some blotters to absorb moisture

73
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:21.810
inside the boards 

74
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.980
and put blotters on the outside 

75
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.100
and then put it under weight 

76
00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.480
pretty much until it's dry. 

77
00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:29.480
I mean, after a little while

78
00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.480
I'll come back, and I'll actually open it up 

79
00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.810
and make sure that the hollow tube 

80
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.730
inside there is still functioning

81
00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:39.400
like a hollow tube. 

82
00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.480
When you use thin paper for those hollow tubes,

83
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:42.940
you have to worry about the adhesive

84
00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.270
actually going through it so . . . 

85
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:55.230
I'm not too worried but . . .

86
00:06:55.250 --> 00:07:05.230


87
00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:15.230


88
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:25.230


89
00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:28.360


90
00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:30.600
I've got those blotter sheets 

91
00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:34.600
right up to the joint in there.

92
00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:44.605
Okay. 

93
00:07:44.625 --> 00:07:45.310


94
00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:55.272
I'll put this there.

95
00:07:55.292 --> 00:08:05.272


96
00:08:05.292 --> 00:08:11.270


97
00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:14.980
[Inaudible] piece here 

98
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.100
I could overlap it all the way,

99
00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.270
but I just want to be able to see it

100
00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:25.940
when I put the weight on top. 

101
00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:35.938
Boards. 

102
00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:42.690


103
00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:46.310
And this is to . . . 

104
00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:47.560
not only hold everything in place 

105
00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:50.600
but to keep it in a flat plane

106
00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:52.860
while it's drying 

107
00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:57.520
because as . . . it wants to distort

108
00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:01.440
as its drying, you know, 
stretching and shrinking.

109
00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:03.810
It can do that, it can go through all of that

110
00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:08.650
if it's unrestrained, it'll just be very cockley.

111
00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:14.100
So this will sit here than for a little while 

112
00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.900
- maybe an hour so - 

113
00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:16.860
before I do anything else with it.

114
00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.270
And then, after that, 

115
00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:21.690
I'll probably be able to open the boards

116
00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:29.150
and actually paste down the cloth hinges

117
00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:32.770
and the sewing slips, and then basically

118
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:34.270
it's cased in at that point. 

119
00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:35.860
The last thing I'll do then is

120
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.900
come back and paste these in place 

121
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.440
on the inside of these boards 

122
00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:44.440
and cover the joint area. 

123
00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:45.560
[Interviewer]: So if you put a title on it 

124
00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:50.560
would that be . . . I assume you'd hand stamp it. 

125
00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:51.770
Would you hand stamp it 

126
00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:54.400
onto a separate piece of goldleaf?

127
00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:56.770
And would you put that on by hand,

128
00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:59.480
or would you use . . . or would you 
put that in the stamper?

129
00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:01.190
[Harry Cambell]: I'll probably use . . .

130
00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:02.810
I'll probably set up some type in the hot stamper 

131
00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:07.520
back there and . . . very small type . . .

132
00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:11.150
and stamp onto a . . . maybe
a dark red piece of leather,

133
00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:14.060
very thin leather that I use for labels,

134
00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:19.770
and then I'll have panel lines on the spine

135
00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:21.480
in a traditional sort of arrangement.

136
00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.310
And near the top will be . . . 

137
00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:24.520
between two of those panel lines

138
00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:25.730
will be this red label 

139
00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:28.560
with the gold title on it . . .

140
00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:31.650
if we put a title on it at all.

141
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:34.270
It may not have had one,

142
00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:35.730
or it may have said "Journal"

143
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:37.020
or something like that.

144
00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:37.810
[Interviewer]: And it looked as though

145
00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:40.730
the original one was actually scratched on.

146
00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:45.400
[Harry Campbell]: Yes that's right: 

147
00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:51.355
"SS Cox Zanesville Ohio USA," it says.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.350
I would normally start with a sharpened spatula,

2
00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.600
a sharpened micro-spatula,

3
00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.640
and just work my way in 

4
00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.620
and under the edges,

5
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.340
and work my way around very, very carefully,

6
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.410
and then at some point,

7
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.710
I take this large pastry knife,

8
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:26.950
which is a very thin . . .

9
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.990
it's not as sharp 

10
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.320
as this  little edge here,

11
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.490
but it's very thin and flexible,

12
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.170
and plus it's very large,

13
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.820
and you can work on a . . .

14
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.230
you have a lot more . . .

15
00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.930
you can do much more gentle kinds of strokes,

16
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.620
and it lifts a larger area at once.

17
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.060
But somehow it's easier to control

18
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.580
than a little small one like this.

19
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.790
I'll just continue here where I was. . . .

20
00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.970
Cooked starch pastes have been around

21
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.980
for a long time,

22
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.810
rice starch paste 

23
00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:20.799
or wheat starch paste.

24
00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:35.801


25
00:01:35.821 --> 00:01:36.110


26
00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.150
You can imagine doing this 

27
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.880
on a large document of some sort 

28
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.880
[Interviewer]: Especially if the size 
of the document is longer than the blade.

29
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.570
[Campbell:]Yeah . . . you actually have to 
get your hand in

30
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.260
underneath it and hold the piece up.

31
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.460
It's quite common in fact,

32
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.810
lifting art . . . artwork from acidic boards

33
00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:03.060
that they have been mounted to, or

34
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:09.090
sometimes photos mounted with heat set tissue.

35
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.710
Like I said, it's quite common

36
00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:14.060
to have to lift them this way,

37
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.530
and it just takes a lot of patience

38
00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.710
and a lot of time.

39
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.840
Luckily, this is very robust paper.

40
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:32.010
It's fairly heavy paper.

41
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:38.320
It's not brittle, not acidic.

42
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.170
It has some . . . it holds together

43
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:54.155
while you are doing this.

44
00:02:54.175 --> 00:03:09.157


45
00:03:09.177 --> 00:03:24.159


46
00:03:24.179 --> 00:03:24.470


47
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.410
Here's the original surface

48
00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.550
of the sheep skin,

49
00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.420
right here where it was not adhered,

50
00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.190
where there was never any glue.

51
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.120
There was never any paste right there,

52
00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.040
so it is sort of undisturbed right there,

53
00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.848
which often is in better condition

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480
So here's the tail from when I started 

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.400
sewing in that first signature,

3
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.360
and then I have come back 

4
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.310
and here's where I am now.

5
00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.190
And I'm going to simply pull these tight,

6
00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:20.188
make sure they're nice and tight along here,

7
00:00:20.208 --> 00:00:26.188


8
00:00:26.208 --> 00:00:27.690


9
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:33.688
and then I will tie a square knot here.

10
00:00:33.708 --> 00:00:39.688


11
00:00:39.708 --> 00:00:45.688


12
00:00:45.708 --> 00:00:50.100


13
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.650
So that anchors the sewing at that point.

14
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.100
As I go up, 

15
00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.020
I will do simply a chain stitch here and here, 

16
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.190
and this is actually called the kettle stitch.

17
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.690
The sewing stations at the beginning and the end,

18
00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.520
that doesn't involve the sewing support,

19
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.980
and it basically chains or links 

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.100
the sections together at the head 

21
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.730
and the tail of the book.

22
00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:23.230
So from here on in,

23
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.688
that's how I will connect each signature.

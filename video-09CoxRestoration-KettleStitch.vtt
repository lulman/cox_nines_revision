00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
I've put them needle through 

2
00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:05.190
between these two sections 

3
00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.560
below the one I'm sewing, 

4
00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.860
and I am going to make a little loop 

5
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:15.060
and bring the needle up through that loop 

6
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.400
like so,

7
00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.270
and pull it tight, 

8
00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:24.900
and that is how all of the sections 

9
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.360
will be linked together from here to the end, 

10
00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.860
and that is called the kettle stitch. 

11
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.813
It is from the German word for a chain stitch.

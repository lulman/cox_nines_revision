00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.320
Well, there are... First of all 

2
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.860
as you can see the cover is quite badly worn, 

3
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.920
it is leather it is scuffed 

4
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.250
a very typical kind of scuffing 

5
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.080
for this kind of leather 

6
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.780
it is pretty much still in one piece 

7
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.510
the pages in the text block 

8
00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:36.350
are still essentially together 

9
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:37.770
at least they are in the right order

10
00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.390
there are some things pasted in here

11
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.010
again, this is a handwritten journal

12
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.080
of a trip to Europe 

13
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.220
this is by Samuel Sullivan Cox 

14
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.210
the journal dates from 1851 

15
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:59.690
this journal would have bee purchased

16
00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.550
the book itself would have been purchased

17
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.460
as a blank book at a stationers

18
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.590
in fact it has a label in it,

19
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.560
the original booksellers label

20
00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.180
sold by William W. Rose, stationer,

21
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.550
19 Wall Street, New York City.

22
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:18.780
It would be a book 

23
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.600
made up with a leather binding 

24
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:22.750
for this purpose 

25
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.330
and he pretty much filled it up

26
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.100
with writing 

27
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:35.220
the covering is a very standard sort

28
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.860
of early of early American sheepskin binding

29
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.070
very plain

30
00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.800
the spine is gone the leather spine

31
00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.330
it would have been a full leather binding

32
00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.630
there is some masking tape on there

33
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:50.630
it's been repaired

34
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:51.830
some water stains

35
00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.940
it's been etched into the cover

36
00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.290
with some sharp tool 

37
00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:05.160
S. S. Cox  can't quite read it

38
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.720
it says something about a journal

39
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.610
it says USA  

40
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.840
it's a very primitive way of titling it

41
00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.740
instead of gold tooling 

42
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.750
or anything like that 

43
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.760
the spine would have been very plain 

44
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.940
probably wouldn't have had a title

45
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.270
and it would have been a plain leather spine

46
00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.330
although there might have been 

47
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.610
some tooled lines across the spine

48
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:36.760
as you can see

49
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.610
the pages here at the folds

50
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.430
this book is made up of sections

51
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.760
of, I don't know, 8 to 10 leaves

52
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.540
folded together and sewn together

53
00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.680
through the center folds

54
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.280
and all these sections are sewn together

55
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.620
and the sewing is joined together

56
00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.130
along the spine

57
00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.250
and you can see the center fold

58
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.270
or the back fold on many

59
00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.770
on most of these sections

60
00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.330
is worn away is broken away

61
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.030
that's from wear and tear

62
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.520
and also the original leather

63
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.550
would have been glued

64
00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.160
right directly to the backbone

65
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.000
to the spine of the paper

66
00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.800
so as that wore down 

67
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.100
it tore that outer fold

68
00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.890
that will be repaired later on.

69
00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:38.610
the first thing I will do is,

70
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.070
I will go through this

71
00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.810
I will think of what needs to be done,

72
00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.630
I have already talked to the curators

73
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.410
what they are interested in

74
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.960
and the whole scope of this project

75
00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.500
LU: It is tempting to think

76
00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.860
that the water damage happened

77
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.390
on the RMS Asia during his crossing

78
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:03.520
of the Atlantic, 

79
00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.450
but it could  have happened

80
00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:07.430
at any time during the past 150 years I suppose

81
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.900
HC: That's right. 

82
00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.550
The water damage is fairly minor

83
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.460
I don't think the text block

84
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.110
in fact has any water damage

85
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.690
and all there may be a few stains

86
00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:23.300
it looks like it might have

87
00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.800
a little bit but there are there is

88
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.150
some staining on the cover

89
00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.570
and in fact it looks like someone

90
00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.400
"coffee cup or something down the cover

91
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:32.392
one point there's a stain here

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480


2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.320
Well, there are.... First of all,

3
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.860
as you can see, the cover is quite badly worn.

4
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.920
It is leather. It is scuffed—

5
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.250
a very typical kind of scuffing

6
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.080
for this kind of leather.

7
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.780
It is pretty much still in one piece.

8
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.510
The pages in the text block

9
00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:36.350
are still essentially together,

10
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:37.770
at least they are in the right order.

11
00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.390
There are some things pasted in here.

12
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.010
Again, this is a handwritten journal

13
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.080
of a trip to Europe. I guess I should mention 

14
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.220
this is by Samuel Sullivan Cox. 

15
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.210
The journal dates from 1851.

16
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:59.690
This journal would have been purchased . . .

17
00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.550
the book itself would have been purchased

18
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.460
as a blank book at a stationers.

19
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.590
In fact, it has a label in it,

20
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.560
the original bookseller's label: 

21
00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.180
sold by William W. Rose, stationer,

22
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.550
19 Wall Street, New York City.

23
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:18.780
It would have been a blank book

24
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.600
made up with a leather binding

25
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:22.750
for this purpose,

26
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.330
and he pretty much filled it up

27
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.100
with writing.

28
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:35.220
The covering is a very standard sort

29
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.860
of early of early American sheepskin binding.

30
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.070
It is very plain.

31
00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.800
The spine is gone . . . the leather spine.

32
00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.330
It would have been a full leather binding.

33
00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.630
There is some masking tape on there.

34
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:50.630
It's been repaired.

35
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:51.830
It's got some water stains.

36
00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.940
It's been etched into the cover

37
00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.290
with some sharp tool: 

38
00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:05.160
S. S. Cox—can't quite read it.

39
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.720
It says something about a journal;

40
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.610
it says USA.  

41
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.840
This is a very primitive way of titling it, I guess—

42
00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.740
instead of gold tooling 

43
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.750
or anything like that.

44
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.760
The spine would have been very plain,

45
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.940
probably wouldn't have had a title on it.

46
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.270
It may have just been a plain leather spine,

47
00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.330
although there might have been 

48
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.610
some tooled lines across the spine.

49
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:36.760
As you can see,

50
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.610
the pages here at the folds . . .

51
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.430
this book is made up of sections

52
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.760
of, I don't know, 8 to 10 leaves

53
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.540
folded together and sewn together

54
00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.680
through the center folds,

55
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.280
and all these sections are sewn together,

56
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.620
and the sewing is joined here

57
00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.130
along the spine,

58
00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.250
and you can see the center fold—

59
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.270
or the back fold—on many,

60
00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.770
on most of these sections

61
00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.330
is worn away is broken away.

62
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.030
That's from wear and tear.

63
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.520
And also the original leather

64
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.550
would have been glued

65
00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.160
right directly to the backbone,

66
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.000
to the spine of the paper,

67
00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.800
so as that wore down 

68
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.100
it tore that outer fold.

69
00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.890
That will be repaired later on.

70
00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:38.610
The first thing I will do is,

71
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.070
I will go through this,

72
00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.810
I will think of what needs to be done.

73
00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.630
I have already talked to the curators

74
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.410
about what they are interested in

75
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.960
and the whole scope of this project.

76
00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.500
[Interviewer]: It is tempting to think

77
00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.860
that the water damage happened

78
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.390
on the RMS Asia during his crossing

79
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:03.520
of the Atlantic, 

80
00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.450
but it could  have happened

81
00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:07.430
at any time during the past 150 years I suppose.

82
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.900
[Campbell]: That's right. 

83
00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.550
The water damage is fairly minor.

84
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.460
I don't think in fact the text block

85
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.110
has any water damage at all.

86
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.690
There may be a few stains.

87
00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:23.300
It looks like it might have

88
00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.800
a little bit but, there are . . . there is

89
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.150
some staining on the cover,

90
00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.570
and in fact it looks like someone put a

91
00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.400
coffee cup or something down the cover

92
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:32.392
at one point. There's a stain here.

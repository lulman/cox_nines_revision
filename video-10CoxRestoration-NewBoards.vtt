00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.230
Well, do you see that little nick

2
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.810
that's been cut off the corner

3
00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:04.730
of the board there?

4
00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.730
That's called back cornering.

5
00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.980
That will allow the leather to. . . . 

6
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.650
When I form the head around here

7
00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:17.600
the leather will tuck down into there

8
00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.230
and it will have a very traditional look,

9
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.230
which you will recognize when you see it.

10
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:23.940
It's a little bit hard to tell here.

11
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.810
Also, the boards have been lined

12
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.770
with a Japanese paper and paste

13
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:31.060
so that they will warp.

14
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.810
You can see the warp in them.

15
00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.770
I just did that this morning.

16
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.940
That is to counteract the damp leather,

17
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.980
which, when it is put on the boards,

18
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.150
and as it dries, it will try to pull it back

19
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.230
that way because the leather will try to shrink.

20
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.060
So this will help counteract that.

21
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.690
Also helping that later on 

22
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.190
will be these pastes . . . 

23
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.270
when I paste these down. 

24
00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.100
As they dry, again, they will tend to shrink

25
00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.060
and pull the boards in. 

26
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.560
[Interviewer]: So basically what you're saying is

27
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:02.730
that if you hadn't done that,

28
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:03.770
the book would've pulled open. 

29
00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.650
[Campbell]: Yes, exactly. The boards would. . . .

30
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.190
Instead of sort of a more traditional,

31
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.480
comfortable sort of boards wrapping

32
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.860
around the text like that

33
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.650
you would have them splaying out like that. 

34
00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.940
[Interviewer]: Is it just the moisture from the glue

35
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.020
that helps it to pull inward, 

36
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.730
or how does it actually work? To get it to . . . 

37
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.310
[Campbell]: It's the . . . As the . . . 

38
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.940
When you put the paste on the paper or the leather

39
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.600
it swells up because the fibers absorbing moisture,

40
00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.020
tend to swell, and then it's . . .

41
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.520
the paste is adhering it to this solid surface . . . 

42
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.270
relatively solid surface. 

43
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.100
So, as the paste dries out and the moisture evaporates,

44
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.980
the fibers in the paper try to go . . . 

45
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.560
and the leather . . . try to go back

46
00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.020
to where they were before.

47
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.860
So they are actually shrinking,

48
00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:59.770
and they are glued . . . 

49
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.100
they are adhered to the surface

50
00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.980
and there if it has enough pull . . . 

51
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.230
it'll pull that board.

52
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.190
It'll warp that board like that.

53
00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.860
And that's what it's doing.

54
00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.480
So you have to balance that out

55
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.440
with what's on the outside 

56
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:13.900
and what's on the inside.

57
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.150
It's not such a big deal on cloth,

58
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.940
but leather you really have to do that.

59
00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.060
And you can see the paper is just pasted on.

60
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:29.022
It's just a sanding block.

61
00:02:29.042 --> 00:02:33.230


62
00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.270
It cuts that loose like that.

63
00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:44.230
Quick and easy.

64
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.400


65
00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.060
Now the boards are ready to go.

66
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.147
I marked them front and back, top.

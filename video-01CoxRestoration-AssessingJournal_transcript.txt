Well, there areâ€¦ First of all 
as you can see the cover is quite badly worn, 
it is leather it is scuffed 
a very typical kind of scuffing 
for this kind of leather 
it is pretty much still in one piece 
the pages in the text block 
are still essentially together 
at least they are in the right order
there are some things pasted in here
again, this is a handwritten journal
of a trip to Europe 
this is by Samuel Sullivan Cox 
the journal dates from 1851 
this journal would have bee purchased
the book itself would have been purchased
as a blank book at a stationers
in fact it has a label in it,
the original booksellers label
sold by William W. Rose, stationer,
19 Wall Street, New York City.
It would be a book 
made up with a leather binding 
for this purpose 
and he pretty much filled it up
with writing 
the covering is a very standard sort
of early of early American sheepskin binding
very plain
the spine is gone the leather spine
it would have been a full leather binding
there is some masking tape on there
it's been repaired
some water stains
it's been etched into the cover
with some sharp tool 
S. S. Cox  can't quite read it
it says something about a journal
it says USA  
it's a very primitive way of titling it
instead of gold tooling 
or anything like that 
the spine would have been very plain 
probably wouldn't have had a title
and it would have been a plain leather spine
although there might have been 
some tooled lines across the spine
as you can see
the pages here at the folds
this book is made up of sections
of, I don't know, 8 to 10 leaves
folded together and sewn together
through the center folds
and all these sections are sewn together
and the sewing is joined together
along the spine
and you can see the center fold
or the back fold on many
on most of these sections
is worn away is broken away
that's from wear and tear
and also the original leather
would have been glued
right directly to the backbone
to the spine of the paper
so as that wore down 
it tore that outer fold
that will be repaired later on.
the first thing I will do is,
I will go through this
I will think of what needs to be done,
I have already talked to the curators
what they are interested in
and the whole scope of this project

LU: It is tempting to think
that the water damage happened
on the RMS Asia during his crossing
of the Atlantic, 
but it could  have happened
at any time during the past 150 years I suppose

HC: That's right. 
The water damage is fairly minor
I don't think the text block
in fact has any water damage
and all there may be a few stains
it looks like it might have
a little bit but there are there is
some staining on the cover
and in fact it looks like someone
"coffee cup or something down the cover
one point there's a stain here

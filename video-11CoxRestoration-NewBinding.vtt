1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.150
Here's the leather. It's calfskin.

2
00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.270
It's fairly similar to what was on here in color,

3
00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.360
although this was sheepskin.

4
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.560
We don't really use sheepskin 
in binding anymore 

5
00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.400
because it deteriorates. 

6
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:15.860
It just doesn't last, 

7
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.480
plus it skins very easily,

8
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.560
it scuffs and skins and separates.

9
00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:27.100
So this is a nice little piece of calfskin 

10
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:32.560
that's made for bookbinding;

11
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.730
It's very stable. 

12
00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.360
Modern methods are used for the tanning. 

13
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.440
It's vegetable tanned leather. 

14
00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:45.060
It's good for dampening and molding 

15
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.600
into the form of a book cover.

16
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.440
As you see, the edges are are thinnerâ€” 

17
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.980
paper-thin edges as opposed to 

18
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.650
the relative thickness in the middle.

19
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.520
In these days they pared the leather 

20
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.860
extremely thin all over, 

21
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.060
so often the books would wear out 

22
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.600
around the edges  

23
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.560
and they would break down in the hinges.

24
00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:10.600
So, today, 

25
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.360
we use the leather a little bit heavier.

26
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.810
We don't pare it so much. 

27
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.480
We only do this edge paring,

28
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.020
which you can see here. 

29
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.190
[Student]: What do you use to pare it? 

30
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.060
[Campbell]: A knife like this. 

31
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.020
It's called a paring knife.

32
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:31.520
And a spoke shave. This one's been altered.

33
00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.150
It has a wider opening. 

34
00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.400
But this is just a wood spoke shave.

35
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.440
And the shape of the blade 

36
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.520
is a little bit different too,

37
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.520
and it's sharpened in a particular way.

38
00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.400
And . . . it's just a matter of doing that.

39
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.900
And this is a matter 

40
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.270
of just going along the edge

41
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.690
and paring it so that you have

42
00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.520
a real nice bevel and very thin edge,

43
00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:59.560
and it gets thinner 

44
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.810
as it goes up toward the edge.

45
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.060
And I do that on glass or a stone

46
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.360
that we have that's special so that it won't 

47
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.230
mark up the table or bang up the knife.

48
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:19.100
So I just wanted to show you those. Okay.

49
00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.730
I'll put that away.

50
00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.400
Now, the first thing I'll do 
is dampen this leather

51
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:31.397
and this . . . 

52
00:02:31.417 --> 00:02:31.860


53
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.600
this allows you to mold the leather into shape.

54
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.360
It also helps the paste-

55
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.730
which we'll put on the other side-

56
00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.480
absorb into the leather

57
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.480
so that the leather becomes sort of saturated

58
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.360
with the paste and. . . .

59
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.360
It's a wheat starch paste that I'm using.

60
00:02:52.380 --> 00:03:02.313
And, I'll just keep that damp.

61
00:03:02.333 --> 00:03:12.313


62
00:03:12.333 --> 00:03:22.313


63
00:03:22.333 --> 00:03:23.980


64
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.360
Here's the paste, here. 

65
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.150
This is fairly sticky stuff. 

66
00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:37.150
It's more like a gelatinous kind of texture.

67
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.810
It doesn't have a lot of real tackiness,

68
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.440
like Elmer's glue 

69
00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.900
or some of the white PBA type of glues 

70
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.360
that we use-polyvinyl acetate-

71
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.810
although you can mix this with that.

72
00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.480
And this is used traditionally with leather . . . 

73
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.230
. . . with paper 

74
00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.230
when you are pasting paper to something 

75
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.020
this is more and more what's used.

76
00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:14.022
I'll go ahead,

77
00:04:14.042 --> 00:04:24.022


78
00:04:24.042 --> 00:04:27.310


79
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.480
and as you see 

80
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.690
we get it pretty well coated.

81
00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:34.650
[Interviewer]: Harry, for Julia, 

82
00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.900
can you look up for a second?

83
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:38.730
[Campbell]: Right at you?

84
00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.100
[Interviewer]: Yep. That's what she asked for.

85
00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.900
[Campbell]: Oh, yeah, for the. . . .

86
00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.650
[Interviewer]: Actually working. . . .

87
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:46.190
[Campbell]: Okay, how did that look?

88
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:52.400
If you need me to do that again. . . .

89
00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.810
So right now I'm going to book this.

90
00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.690
At least that's what they call it 

91
00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:02.440
in working with wallpaper.

92
00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.980
I don't know if there is a term for it 
in book binding.

93
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.810
Just gonna let that soak for a little bit.

94
00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:20.772
Has anyone ever done wallpaper?

95
00:05:20.792 --> 00:05:23.560


96
00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.400
Get this a little wet.

97
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.150
[Interviewer]: Let's try another one.

98
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:27.310
Can you just sort of pause

99
00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.480
and look up?

100
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.980
Good.

101
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.270
[Campbell]: I think I was blinking.

102
00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:42.020
[Interviewer]: You were.

103
00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.600
[Campbell]: Anytime you want me to do that,

104
00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:51.150
let me know.

105
00:05:51.170 --> 00:06:01.105
I'm just gonna 
let that soak for a bit.

106
00:06:01.125 --> 00:06:01.270


107
00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:06.150
These are going to be used, obviously, 

108
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:09.150
to assemble the case.

109
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.440
This will go in between those.

110
00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.150
It will actually go on the spine.

111
00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:16.940
It's not absolutely necessary since I have

112
00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.400
a hollow lining on that,

113
00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.690
but I like to give the spine 

114
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:23.940
a little bit more substance [inaudible],

115
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.060
and often when you're making . . .

116
00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.310
when you are doing a leather case binding,

117
00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.440
it's easier to construct like a regular case.

118
00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:37.230
Which, in fact is three pieces.

119
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:38.730
The same is true for that book

120
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.860
and most clothbound books. And this one,

121
00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.480
although it was case-bound,

122
00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.150
it was not done that way; 

123
00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:50.310
it had the leather . . .

124
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:51.100
it didn't have any kind of inlay strip like this 

125
00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.980
down the spine,  

126
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.730
it just had the leather right to the spine.

127
00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:58.770
I could do it that way, but, again,

128
00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:06.360
it's going to be more flexible doing it

129
00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:13.560
the way that I'm doing it with the hollow tube.

130
00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.600
Also, in the head cap areas here 

131
00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:20.560
where the leather's turned over,

132
00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:23.600
I'll put these little bits of. . . . 

133
00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:26.360
They're hard to see, but they're. . . .

134
00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:29.100
It's a little linen twine,

135
00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.900
I've rolled it in a little bit of adhesive

136
00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.230
to give it some substance 
and keep it all together.

137
00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:36.440
But when I turn the leather over,

138
00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:38.020
I'll put those in

139
00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:41.690
at the top and the bottom of the spine 

140
00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:45.900
so that the leather forms a little cap.

141
00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:51.060
Often books that are bound in leather . . .

142
00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.400
they have some kind of decorative end band 

143
00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:54.650
at the top and the bottom of the spine,

144
00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:56.980
and the leather is formed over thatâ€”

145
00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.940
little caps are formed over that.

146
00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:03.060
This book didn't have any bands and . . .

147
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.360
probably because of the type of book it was,

148
00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:09.270
it would've just had the leather turned over 

149
00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:14.150
and some kind of head caps formed which. . . .

150
00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:17.980
And if there had been any evidence of . . .

151
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.480
if there had been end bands 
sewn on or pasted on

152
00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:22.690
at some point, there would've been

153
00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:27.690
some kind of evidence, and there wasn't really.

154
00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:30.230
So I'm not putting any end bands on this book,

155
00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:31.650
but I'm going to use these to make a little 

156
00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:37.060
. . . to give it a little shape

157
00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:43.940
and form head caps.

158
00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:47.150
And that's just cut out of that.

159
00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:49.810
Okay. Usually I would do . . .

160
00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:53.020
if I was doing a drawn-on leather binding,

161
00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.360
and I was going to do a lot of shaping and. . . .

162
00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:55.900
It's a lot more complicated

163
00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.480
because the book is all in one piece,

164
00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.900
and you've got to do the turn ends

165
00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.690
and you've got to work in behind the spine

166
00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:05.360
and get on the inside of the boards.

167
00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:07.730
It's a little trickier,

168
00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:09.560
and I would probably let it saturate 

169
00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:10.360
for a little bit longer,

170
00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:11.480
but with this one

171
00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:12.230
I'm not going to have to 

172
00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:15.440
do quite so much of that molding, 

173
00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:20.440
so I'm going to get this one ready to go now.

174
00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:30.438
Another layer of paste.

175
00:09:30.458 --> 00:09:40.438


176
00:09:40.458 --> 00:09:50.438


177
00:09:50.458 --> 00:09:58.810


178
00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:01.560
Most often, working with leather,

179
00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:03.730
I would work on a glass surface 

180
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:04.980
or right on this Formica, 

181
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.310
but but this'll be fine.

182
00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:09.020
It shows up better 

183
00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:13.730
and you can see it a little bit easier 
. . . what I'm doing.

184
00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:15.600
Okay. I'm going to take the. . . .

185
00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:17.860
I think I'll start with the center piece 

186
00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:24.520
and put it down 
approximately in the center here.

187
00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:26.440
[Interviewer]: You don't need to measure 
or anything like that?

188
00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:27.560
[Campbell]: What?

189
00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:28.940
[Interviewer]: Do you just eyeball it?

190
00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:31.860
[Campbell]: Just eyeball it, yeah.

191
00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.360
That's one thing, you sort of learn

192
00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:37.270
to trust your eyes as you go along, you know.

193
00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:41.690
So, and then I'm going to need a bit of space

194
00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:45.440
here right in the shoulder 
of the joint area there,

195
00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:47.560
and I've already kind of determined 

196
00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:49.940
how tightly I want the book . . .

197
00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.980
those boards to sit up in there again, 

198
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.150
a book like this . . . most case-bound books 

199
00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:56.980
have a joint right here.

200
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.060
You can see that okay?

201
00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.730
Most leather-bound books, although not all,

202
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:06.980
have a tight joint, 
where basically the board fits,

203
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.650
you know, and the leather 
goes smooth right over that.

204
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:15.560
And what I do when I do a binding like this,

205
00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:18.900
I don't form real hard shoulders,

206
00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:20.810
just gently sort of sloping up, 

207
00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:21.600
and I don't try 

208
00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:23.310
to put the boards up too tight to them 

209
00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:25.360
when I make the binding. 

210
00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:27.600
It's going to look like a tight back,

211
00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:30.060
but it will have a bit more flexibility

212
00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.810
in the joint. 

213
00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:37.770
So, I've got this down here.

214
00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:43.900
I'll let that sit there for a minute.

215
00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:46.310
I'll take the back board. 

216
00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:55.190
Let's look at this leather one more time.

217
00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:56.980
I guess it doesn't make much difference.

218
00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.650
Sometimes there are flaws in the leather

219
00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:05.770
and you put them on the back.

220
00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:08.230
Or if you're going to be doing some tooling

221
00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:11.810
or you have the spine a certain way

222
00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:15.230
and, you know, 
you want to kind of pay attention 

223
00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:18.650
to what the leather looks like on the outside.

224
00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:27.400
So I'm going to just place that board,

225
00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:34.810
approximately there, 
which is about 3/16 of an inch-

226
00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:40.690
in case you're interested in 
the actual distance-

227
00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:45.360
and place the front board there.

228
00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:45.980
And you'll notice 

229
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:53.520
I put those back-cornered corners 
right here and there.

230
00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:57.520
I'm assuming that's going to fit okay.

231
00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:01.560
Give it a little test.

232
00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:09.560


233
00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:11.600
That should be fine.

234
00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:21.605
I'll get them a little closer.

235
00:13:21.625 --> 00:13:31.150


236
00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:39.560
I'm going to lay these little bits of twine

237
00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:40.310


238
00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:42.270
right there and there.

239
00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:43.270
Hopefully they're not so small

240
00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:46.650
that they roll underneath the inlay strip

241
00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:49.360
or get lost in there, because they're pretty thin.

242
00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:52.400
I didn't want to make 
a real big substantial head cap.

243
00:13:52.420 --> 00:14:02.060
This one's pretty small and more delicate.

244
00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:09.900
Okay. Now the . . . 

245
00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:19.897
now that I got those there. . . .

246
00:14:19.917 --> 00:14:27.480


247
00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:37.270
Put a new scalpel blade in here.

248
00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:47.272
Because I want that to be really sharp.

249
00:14:47.292 --> 00:14:52.690


250
00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:55.770
Basically, I'm going to cut these corners off

251
00:14:55.790 --> 00:15:02.400
at a 45Âº angle and start 
turning in all this leather.

252
00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:03.440
But . . . you'll see.

253
00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:05.940
I'll come back to the corners.

254
00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:11.440
Is it in the way 
if I'm putting my hand here like that?

255
00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:21.397
Okay.

256
00:15:21.417 --> 00:15:24.520


257
00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:25.480
I'm cutting at an angle

258
00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:28.940
so that it will have the little bevel cut

259
00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:33.270
there you can see. 

260
00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:34.020
Like I said, 

261
00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:35.190
I'm going to come back to that 

262
00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:36.400
and refine that as I go along,

263
00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:46.397
as I start turning them in.

264
00:15:46.417 --> 00:15:56.397


265
00:15:56.417 --> 00:16:06.397


266
00:16:06.417 --> 00:16:16.397


267
00:16:16.417 --> 00:16:26.397


268
00:16:26.417 --> 00:16:28.360


269
00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:38.355
Okay. 

270
00:16:38.375 --> 00:16:42.360


271
00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:44.600
Now the . . . this is simply a matter

272
00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:54.605
of bringing the leather over. 

273
00:16:54.625 --> 00:16:55.400


274
00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:56.690
These are called folders; 

275
00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:58.940
they used to be made of bone.

276
00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:01.230
This is a bone folder, and this is Teflon.

277
00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:04.520
This is much better to work with leather.

278
00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:07.100
This is a pretty modern invention.

279
00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:08.600
But it doesn't mar the leather.

280
00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:12.440
You have to be very careful 

281
00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:13.440
when you are working with wet leather. 

282
00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:16.230
Especially metal or bone folders can . . .

283
00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:19.600
If you rub it too hard it can leave a dark line,

284
00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:21.900
you know, not only a dent but a . . .

285
00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:28.480
it kind of darkens.

286
00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:32.310
You pull that around not too tightly,

287
00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:37.650
do a little shaping, and here,

288
00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:42.520
I am going to push back 

289
00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:43.940
on that little piece of thread

290
00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:52.020
that I have in there.

291
00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:55.100
I think it's right where I want it. 

292
00:17:55.120 --> 00:18:05.063
Okay.

293
00:18:05.083 --> 00:18:15.063


294
00:18:15.083 --> 00:18:25.063


295
00:18:25.083 --> 00:18:25.440


296
00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:26.730
Like I said, I don't want to stretch this

297
00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:30.440
too tight because leather when it's wet,

298
00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:32.230
you can really stretch it.

299
00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:34.400
Of course, what happens when it dries?

300
00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:36.310
It needs to go back to where it was before.

301
00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:41.230
So I don't want it pulling too much as it dries.

302
00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:51.230
So I'm not wrapping these around too tightly.

303
00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:56.360


304
00:18:56.380 --> 00:19:06.355
Okay. Turn these over. 

305
00:19:06.375 --> 00:19:12.020


306
00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:13.150
I guess before I do that . . .

307
00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:23.147
I should . . . [inaudible]

308
00:19:23.167 --> 00:19:25.730


309
00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:27.860
I'm going to do a little bit of additional thinning

310
00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:31.520
on these corners here and . . .

311
00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:34.230
my hand is going to be 
right in your way, probably.

312
00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:35.190
[Interviewer]: I don't want you to cut yourself. 

313
00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:38.230
I can move.

314
00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:44.400
[Campbell]: No, let's see, this might work.

315
00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:54.355
I'll just do it this way.

316
00:19:54.375 --> 00:20:02.690


317
00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:03.900
Right at the point of that corner . . .

318
00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:05.860
I'm just thinning it out. . . .

319
00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:08.270
See, I've scooped out a little area here.

320
00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:11.100
So I've got the paper edged in there-

321
00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:16.230
the thin edge.

322
00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:22.100
While I'm doing that, I'll do all four corners. 

323
00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:23.690
[Interviewer]: How fast does the glue 
begin to dry? 

324
00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:25.310
How fast do you need to work? 

325
00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:28.690
[Campbell]: The paste lasts . . . 
stays wet for a long time.

326
00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:29.560
[Interviewer]: Good.

327
00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:39.563
[Campbell]: Yeah. 

328
00:20:39.583 --> 00:20:49.563


329
00:20:49.583 --> 00:20:55.810


330
00:20:55.830 --> 00:21:05.813
Let's go back and do these too.

331
00:21:05.833 --> 00:21:15.813


332
00:21:15.833 --> 00:21:25.813


333
00:21:25.833 --> 00:21:27.600


334
00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:28.440
I cut a lot out of that one.

335
00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:38.438
I hope I have enough left.

336
00:21:38.458 --> 00:21:48.438


337
00:21:48.458 --> 00:21:58.438


338
00:21:58.458 --> 00:22:06.770


339
00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:16.730
Okay, let's start this over again.

340
00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:26.730


341
00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:36.730


342
00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:46.730


343
00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:51.150


344
00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:57.230
As you can see, paste is fairly forgiving.

345
00:22:57.250 --> 00:22:58.770
But it is slippery too,

346
00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:08.772
so you have to watch 
that things don't move around.

347
00:23:08.792 --> 00:23:18.772


348
00:23:18.792 --> 00:23:28.772


349
00:23:28.792 --> 00:23:38.772


350
00:23:38.792 --> 00:23:48.772


351
00:23:48.792 --> 00:23:58.772


352
00:23:58.792 --> 00:24:08.813


353
00:24:08.833 --> 00:24:18.813


354
00:24:18.833 --> 00:24:28.813


355
00:24:28.833 --> 00:24:37.360


356
00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:38.270
This is exactly how the corners

357
00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:40.440
would have been done on a binding like this.

358
00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:43.310
No fuss, just thin the leather out a little bit

359
00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:46.520
and push it all together.

360
00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:49.400
Whereas in fine binding, fine leather binding,

361
00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:52.100
there are ways of making the corner

362
00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:53.600
very perfect, you know. 

363
00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:54.980
So that the leather molds over

364
00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:04.980
very nicely, no overlapping.

365
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:14.980


366
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:24.980


367
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:34.980


368
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.060


369
00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:41.020
But when you rebind a book this way,

370
00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:43.770
you don't want it to look. . . .

371
00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:47.360
You know if it was real perfect 
and real refined-

372
00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:50.730
had handsewn end bands and all thatâ€”
it would look . . .

373
00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:53.020
it would be . . . it might look nice 

374
00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:54.560
but in a way, it would be awkward,

375
00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:57.360
and we are basically trying to replicate

376
00:25:57.380 --> 00:26:02.940
what was there before.

377
00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:05.650
Just because, you know, 
in a way, it's restoration.

378
00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:07.190
We know what it looked like before,

379
00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:10.980
and we have . . . and the materials are not,

380
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:17.480
in most cases, reusable. So. 

381
00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:27.400
That's looking all right.

382
00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:37.313


383
00:26:37.333 --> 00:26:45.860


384
00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:47.900
The edges of the original boards

385
00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:50.560
would have been much thinner

386
00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:53.690
because for one thing, 
the boards were thinner

387
00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:56.980
and also the leather was pared very thin.

388
00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.020
So these will be thicker and bulkier looking,

389
00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:08.730
but you can try to compromise

390
00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:12.770
with having a big . . . 
a heavier leather on there

391
00:27:12.790 --> 00:27:15.480
and a slightly thicker board 

392
00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:17.480
with edges that are not too bulky 

393
00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:22.520
and too indelicate. 

394
00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:29.600
I'm trying to do a little shaping.

395
00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:33.480
Okay. 

396
00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:37.600
Now this was . . .  

397
00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:42.230
I'll set that thing here a moment. . . .

398
00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:52.188
I'm going to make a little cap 
for this text block.

399
00:27:52.208 --> 00:28:02.188


400
00:28:02.208 --> 00:28:09.100


401
00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:18.150
This will just protect 
the edges of the text block

402
00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:21.440
from . . . offsetting the leather and

403
00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:31.397
any dyes in the leather and the moisture.

404
00:28:31.417 --> 00:28:41.397


405
00:28:41.417 --> 00:28:51.397


406
00:28:51.417 --> 00:29:01.438


407
00:29:01.458 --> 00:29:11.438


408
00:29:11.458 --> 00:29:21.438


409
00:29:21.458 --> 00:29:31.438


410
00:29:31.458 --> 00:29:33.100


411
00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:37.060
I want the shoulder area here 

412
00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:38.940
to essentially line up with the edge

413
00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:41.190
of this board right there,

414
00:29:41.210 --> 00:29:43.810
and that this white inlay strip here

415
00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:46.520
is the same width as the spine.

416
00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:56.480
And they will be connected together, so.

417
00:29:56.500 --> 00:30:06.522


418
00:30:06.542 --> 00:30:16.522


419
00:30:16.542 --> 00:30:24.270


420
00:30:24.290 --> 00:30:25.400
Okay. 

421
00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:29.560
At this point I'm just doing

422
00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:39.563
an initial sort of fitting,

423
00:30:39.583 --> 00:30:49.563


424
00:30:49.583 --> 00:30:59.563


425
00:30:59.583 --> 00:31:09.563


426
00:31:09.583 --> 00:31:19.563


427
00:31:19.583 --> 00:31:29.563


428
00:31:29.583 --> 00:31:31.020


429
00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:34.940
making sure it's all going to line up right

430
00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:41.520
and pretty even.

431
00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:44.480
At this point, 

432
00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:48.730
I'm going to . . .

433
00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:58.730
make a little impression there.

434
00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:08.270


435
00:32:08.290 --> 00:32:11.940
That's that back cornered area I was talking about.

436
00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:16.150
So you see it's starting to take the form of a 

437
00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:26.147
traditional leather-bound book.

438
00:32:26.167 --> 00:32:27.560


439
00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:29.690
Now I've got this right where I want it,

440
00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:36.440
so I'm gonna open the board 
and leave it sitting here,

441
00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:44.690
and I'm going to use 
a modern adhesive here to . . .

442
00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:51.230
this is a blend 
of polyvinyl acetate adhesive and paste

443
00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:54.860
and it's a little tackier 
and stronger and dries faster.

444
00:32:54.880 --> 00:33:04.855
And I'm going to use that to attach the inlay to the . . .

445
00:33:04.875 --> 00:33:05.940


446
00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:15.938
to the spine here. 

447
00:33:15.958 --> 00:33:25.938


448
00:33:25.958 --> 00:33:35.938


449
00:33:35.958 --> 00:33:45.938


450
00:33:45.958 --> 00:33:55.938


451
00:33:55.958 --> 00:34:05.100


452
00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:08.860
So I am coating both surfaces with a very thin coat . . .

453
00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:13.520
which . . .

454
00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:15.190
there won't be a lot of excess moisture there,

455
00:34:15.210 --> 00:34:16.190
it will dry faster, 

456
00:34:16.210 --> 00:34:17.400
and when I put the two together,

457
00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:24.980
they will grab each other.

458
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.650
There'll be two tacky surfaces coming together

459
00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:30.150
instead of one.

460
00:34:30.170 --> 00:34:31.100
Okay, now I'm going to, 

461
00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:32.900
again, bring this back over

462
00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:38.940
where it was before, and I can feel

463
00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:43.150
that the boards are down 
on the inside of that shoulder,

464
00:34:43.170 --> 00:34:48.230
and you can see about where that . . . 

465
00:34:48.250 --> 00:34:51.860
the joint actually is.

466
00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:55.060
Again, we won't be pressing that 
into a French joint,

467
00:34:55.080 --> 00:35:00.980
which is what this is called.

468
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.480
But in fact there is a space there.

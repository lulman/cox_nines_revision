         <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
         
         <p>Samuel Sullivan Cox (1824–1889) served as a Democratic congressman
            in the United States House of Representative from 1856 until his death, save
            for a few short interruptions, first representing his native Ohio (he was
            born in Zanesville) and then, from 1868 onward, his adopted state of New
            York. As a public servant, he is most remembered, even revered, for
            strengthening the Life-Saving Service (a precursor to the Coast Guard) and
            improving the working conditions of mail carriers. As a Democratic
            politician, his legacy is marred by his oft-assumed role as spokesperson for
            his party's resistance to abolition and emancipation during the years
            leading up to the Civil War. As an author, Cox published articles and books
            throughout his life on political and popular subjects, including six travel
            books. But in May 1851, Cox was a twenty-six-year-old Brown University
            graduate who had moved back to Ohio to practice law and had recently married
            (Peskin). On May 7, he and his wife Julia (née Buckingham, whom he married
            in October 1849), along with her brother Philo Buckingham and a cousin, Lucy Sturges,
            set sail
            on a long-delayed honeymoon tour of Europe and the Orient (Linsey
            204–205).
            
         </p>
         
         <p>The manuscript journal presented in this edition records Cox's experiences
            and reflections during the trip, but it also serves as a sketch pad for an
            expanded account of the voyage that Cox published the following year, <cite>A Buckeye abroad; or, Wanderings in Europe and in the
               Orient</cite> (1852). Appearing seventeen years before Mark Twain's more
            famous debut as a travel writer, <cite>The Innocents Abroad; or,
               The New Pilgrims Progress</cite> (1869), <cite>A Buckeye
               Abroad</cite> is still far from the first account in English of a "grand
            tour" of Europe. Both Twain and Cox offer similar apologia for publishing yet another account of a grand tour. Twain presents
            himself as everyman, rather than guide or critic: 
            <div class="blockquote"><br>Yet
               notwithstanding it is only a record of a picnic, it has a purpose, which
               is to suggest to the reader how he would be
               likely to see Europe and the East if he looked at them with his own eyes
               instead of the eyes of those who traveled in those countries before him.
               (xvii)<br><br></div> Cox presents a similarly self-effacing ethos: 
            <div class="blockquote"><br>The only merit reserved for a volume of travels is, either that the
               ground is untrodden, or that the mode of observation is new and peculiar.
               The author can lay no claim to the former. Something may be conceded to
               him, from the fact imported by the title—<cite>A Buckeye Abroad</cite>. A
               native of the west, and of that part, familiarly known as the Buckeye
               State,—may be supposed to look upon the scenes and mingle with
               the throngs of the Old World with new and peculiar sensations, which may
               find sympathy, if not with the general reader, at least with readers in
               Ohio. (5)<br><br></div> Of course, the degree to which Cox (or Twain, for that
            matter) presents "new and peculiar" views of Europe to his contemporaries is
            open to interpretation. In Cox's notes about each stage of
            his party's journey, however, twenty-first-century readers are sure to find
            insights into an historical and cultural milieu removed in time and
            sensibility from our own—even as we recognize long-enduring conventions of
            travel and tourism as well as familiar dynamics of cross-cultural encounters.

         <h3 id="crossing">Crossing the Atlantic</h3>
         
         <p>Describing his party's
            departure from Jersey City, NJ in the RMS <i>Asia</i> on
            May 7, Cox conveys excitement, confidence, and eager anticipation. Still
            within sight of land, he enthuses, they spotted a young whale: "Hurrah! He
            spouted away throwing the spray 20 ft. high. No sensation of sickness yet.
            All is exhileration [sic]." Not for long. On May 8th, he writes with
            determination, "Sick to day, but able to be about. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
            had to keep on deck today—or give in." The next day his mood
            turns: "Lay wretchedly all morning," he tells us, "Realized the horrors."
            Then he falls silent until May 13, unable in the interim "to do anything
            except lay sick." Cox's bout with sea-sickness was not the result of a
            particularly weak stomach; rather, it reminds us of the rigors of the early
            days of transatlantic passenger service on small steamships. The
            <i>Asia</i>, the largest ship in the British and North
            American Royal Mail Steam Packet Company's fleet when it was built the year
            before Cox's trip, was a wooden-hulled sidewheeler, 266 feet long by 40 wide
            with a gross tonnage of 2,226. By contrast, the current flagship of the
            Cunard Line, the <i>Queen Mary 2</i>, is 1,132 feet long
            by 135 feet wide abeam with an approximate gross tonnage of 151,400 (Cunard
            Line). The ride, in short, was rough in any seas. These early pages of Cox's
            journal also contain more subtle evidence of how violently the ship would
            pitch and roll. While most of the journal is written in ink, the pages
            composed at sea are written first in pencil, then traced over at some later
            date in ink. Presumably, Cox didn't trust himself on the bounding main with
            an open bottle of ink and a fountain pen!
         </p>
         
         <p>In light of the discomfort he describes in ever more vivid prose (at one
            point he laments that his sensibilities have been reduced to the
            "nauseate sublime"), there is more than a little dramatic
            irony in his fascination with the technology of sailing. "Was there
            ever such perfection of enginery," he gushes at one point,
            "so massive yet so perfect; so powerful so fit." Yet he
            captures the public's fascination with the rapidly advancing technology of
            steamship travel, particularly the competition between the British Cunard
            Line and the American Collins Line during the 1850s to build ever bigger,
            more powerful ships that would provide the fastest, most elegant
            transatlantic crossing (Babcock 91–101). Cox provides a front-row
            view of that international competition in his description of the <i>Asia's</i> encounter with the U.S. steamer <i>Humboldt</i> (not a Collins ship) and his speculation that the
            <i>Asia</i> will beat the best crossing time of the
            Collins steamer <i>Pacific</i>.
         </p>
         
         <p>Cox's prose, as much as his subjects, characterize him as a writer
            developing his distinctive voice. His writing—and
            sensibilities—are clearly informed by his reading. In the space of a
            single journal entry on May 13th, he quotes Washington Irving, Robert
            Burton, William Wordsworth, Jonathan Sewall, and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. He
            also draws on a rich—if sometimes overwrought—pictorial
            imagination, an ability to sketch sentimental and often didactic tableaux in words.
            Describing a small bird he sees somewhere off the coast of Nova Scotia or
            Newfoundland, Cox writes,
            <div class="blockquote"><br>How beautiful would be the song of
               that little chorister upon a "bough swaying in the
               breeze" in some sequestered nook amid a leafy valley surrounded
               with green prospects &amp; smiling cultivation. How like a hymn to
               its Creator would go up its carol to the All Audient creator;—yet here it
               is, with fagged wing &amp; panting breast, contending with harsh cold
               blasts, just able to overtop the snow spray of the mid Ocean,—deluded
               from its home in the bosom of the wood by the mysteries of the Unknown, a
               thing of song in a sea of chaos—soon to [be] whelmed forever! Is it not
               an epitome of Man when he breaks the golden chords of that harmony which
               binds him to his God!<br><br></div> Cox's skill at this sort of writing would earn
            him the sobriquet "Sunset Cox" after the appearance in 1853 of an effusive
            description of a sunset published in <cite>The Ohio
               Statesman</cite>, a political journal that he owned and edited in Columbus,
            Ohio. Introducing a reprint of Cox's sunset essay in a 1910 volume of <cite>Ohio History</cite>, E. O. Randall calls Cox a "master word
            painter" (331). However, in his Preface to <cite>A Buckeye Abroad</cite>,
            Cox somewhat more modestly characterizes his literary allusions and
            descriptive prose as spontaneous <i>plein air</i>
            daguerreotypes of the scenes before
            him:
            <div class="blockquote"><br>The impressions herein recorded were mostly taken upon
               the spot, and the allusions, historical, classical, or otherwise, were
               not sought for, but sprung out of the time and locality. Each lineament
               of each form in Nature or Art, each custom and characteristic were
               daguerreotyped, though somewhat rapidly, if not imperfectly, from the
               original, as it appeared in itself and in its environment. (6)<br><br></div> While
            it lies beyond the scope of this introduction to test Cox's claims, it is
            worth noting here that the journal, from the early entries onward, provides
            a rough means of gauging the spontaneity and directness of the writing in <cite>A Buckeye Abroad</cite> and the degree to which it results from
            revision and expansion.
            
         </p>
         
         <p>
            As the <i>Asia</i> approaches Great Britain, Cox regains his sea legs and his appetite, 
            finding the energy to explore the ship and even to appreciate, once again, the 
            grandeur of the open ocean. Nevertheless, upon sight of the English coast, he enthuses,
            
            "And this is England! Glorious old England." 
            
         </p>
         
         <h3 id="liverpool">Liverpool</h3>
         
         <p>Cox's entries from Liverpool convey contagious amazement: 
            "How can I describe my feelings at the grand illumination?" Inevitably, his impressions
            are 
            filtered through his reading and cultural biases: He first introduces us to the social
            scene 
            of Liverpool by describing a street urchin as a "veritable O. Twist, who in his tatters
            and 
            with a bow &amp; a touch of an apochryphal [sic] cap requested to carry the carpet bag."
            
         </p>
         
         <p>
            With a storyteller's ear for dialogue, he transcribes the speech of colorful characters:
            
            "Soon came upon another liar. 'Waterloo Sir?' Sorry it's full Sir, I am boots there'
            Sir 
            three ships just in hrs—Victoria Hotel is near—great hotel." With a travel writer's
            eye for 
            landscape, architecture, and monuments, he provides a walking tour of Liverpool and
            its 
            environs: "The Corinthian elegance of the architecture here &amp; the neatness &amp; well
            
            pavedness of the streets are permanent." And with a sketchbook artist's attention
            to detail, 
            he occasionally draws a sketch in the margins of the journal. 
            
         </p>
         
         <h3 id="london">London</h3>
         
         <p>Arriving in London on 19 May, Cox spends his first full day, 
            Tuesday, May 20th, visiting the famous Crystal Palace, which housed the Great Exhibition
            of 1851, 
            to view its "splendid contents." Over the next three days, he and his companions 
            take in the Crystal Palace, an opera, the Epsom Derby, and a host of other tourist
            sites. They 
            even indulge in a bit of paparazzi-style rubbernecking at royalty, seizing a chance
            to chase 
            down Queen Victoria while riding in a hansom cab: "I asked the driver if it was the
            Queen, he 
            said Yes—'Drive after them!' Away went the sovereign of Gt B. Away after went us 
            Sovereigns in chase. . . . we got pretty close. Whereupon to our open Eyes and outstretched
            
            necks, the Queen herself turned round &amp; gave us a good look &amp; full view."
            
         </p>
         
         <p>In addition to taking in the cultural sights—galleries, exhibitions, monuments, horse
            
            races, and royalty—this newly minted lawyer and future career politician makes a point
            
            of visiting the British Parliament. On May 23, he describes the (to his sensibilities
            
            chaotic) scene at the House of Commons and pastes into his journal a clipping from
            the 
            <cite>Times</cite> recounting a debate on the Ecclesiastical Titles Assumptions bill.
            
         </p>
         
         <p>Cox occasionally leavens his veneration of all things British with a pinch of Yankee
            pride, 
            as he does when he declares the Princess Theatre at best only on par with the grandest
            theaters 
            in the United States.
            
         </p>
         
         <p>The journal also reveals the quotidian trials and details of extended international
            travel in 
            1851 (most of which still ring true today): Cox more than once loses track of the
            day and date, 
            he repeatedly visits banks to deal with business back home or manage his funds (he
            stops by 
            Barings bank in London), and he must regularly secure visas for upcoming legs of the
            journey.
            
         </p>
         
         <h3 id="paris">Paris and Southern France</h3>
         
         <p>Cox arrives in Paris interested mainly 
            in obtaining passports before moving on to Italy (or, more exactly, the various states
            that 
            would comprise a united Italy after the 1860s and 70s), spending only one full day
            in the 
            French capital, though a day he describes as "A perfect day of wonders." One special
            wonder 
            turns out to be his own ability to speak French with his cabman: "My proficiency astonished
            
            me. Guess we can get along thro' France."
         </p>
         
         <p>As the party heads south toward Italy and Rome, Cox takes particular note of the "Roman
            
            monuments in Gaul." Upon seeing a ruined viaduct in Avignon (probably the Pont du
            Gard) near 
            which a proud new suspension bridge has been built, he exclaims, "How the old and
            new 
            civilization is contrasted."
            
         </p>
         
         <h3 id="sardinia">Sardinia and Tuscany</h3>
         
         <p>Traveling  from Marseilles to Genoa (Sardinia), 
            Cox encounters—and describes—other travelers from the U.S., as he does 
            occasionally during his travels. On board the <i>Languedoc</i>, he meets 
            the author Ann Sophia Stephens, who is traveling with George and Julia Pratt, the
            children of 
            Judge Zadoch Pratt of New York. Cox describes Mrs. Stephens somewhat cryptically as
            
            "caustically agreeable."
            
         </p>
         
         <p>Arriving in Leghorn (Tuscany) on June 4, Cox finds another reminder of home—the 
            <i>U.S.S. Mississippi</i>—anchored in the port. On board the party 
            meets the American sculptor Hiram Powers, most famous for his statue of the "Greek
            Slave" 
            (1843), which was on display at the Great Exhibition. Significantly, given the political
            
            turmoil in Europe at this time, Cox's party will encounter several other U.S. warships
            
            during their travels, and Cox occasionally records discussions of politics with the
            locals.
            
         </p>
         
         <h3 id="rome">"Eternal Rome" and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies</h3>
         
         <p>Upon his arrival 
            at the port of Civita Veccia, Cox offers his "verdict re. Italians," contrasting the
            
            "higher classes," whom he finds "decent, polite &amp; refined," with the "lower classes,"
            who 
            "look hard, in dirty tatters, and with saucy deportment — mishaven [sic] 
            and sallow—&amp; seemingly incapable of a noble thought." He laments that they represent
            
            "the degenerate scion of the old Roman tree!" This tendency to interpret the appearance
            and 
            living conditions of the poor in terms of character is all too familiar, but it is
            
            especially troubling and ironic given Cox's attention to political oppression elsewhere
            
            (later in his travels, he rails against Ferdinand II, "the brutal despot of Naples").
            
         </p>
         
         <p>Rome, however, elicits Cox's veneration of Roman antiquities, which he describes with
            great 
            detail in lengthy journal entries.
            
         </p>
         
         <h3 id="orient">The "Dreamy Orient."</h3>
         
         <p>By contrast, Cox writes relatively little 
            about Athens and Greece (and spends relatively little time there). En route to Constantinople
            
            via Smyrna, he describes islands nestled between the coasts of Greece and Turkey in
            the Aegean 
            Sea: Tenedos, Lemnos, and Lesbos. After weaving through the Aegean, threading the
            Dardanelles, 
            and steaming up the Bosphorus, the party finally arrives in the "Dreamy Orient."
            
         </p>
         
         <p>Accompanied by an American consul and local firman, Cox and his company explore mosques
            
            (including the Hagia Sophia), seraglios, harems, splendid flower and fruit gardens,
            
            fountains of goldfish, and the "richly ornamented" tomb of Sultan Mahmoud II.
            
         </p>
         
         <p>Stopping at Smyrna on their return, Cox and Philo take a traditional Turkish bath,
            and Cox 
            records a sensuously detailed account of the process: "The attendant rubs us with
            glove hand 
            with warm water, which is grateful &amp; good. He pours bowl on bowl over the entranced
            body 
            until the frame almost chills with delight. The head forms the point 
            from which the dripping water falls all around. A soft &amp; pleasant sensation comes
            over 
            the mind; not intense &amp; thrilling; but mellowed &amp; tender as a sunset would produce
            or 
            a picture of Murillo. Soon P &amp; I began to throw the warm water at each other; in the
            mean 
            time the sweat running, &amp; the sensation robbing the body of all save enjoyment." 
            
            Not surprisingly, Cox omits most of this private description  from <cite>A 
               Buckeye Abroad</cite>.
            
         </p>
         
         <h3 id="trieste">Trieste, Venetia, and Lombardy</h3> 
         
         <p>Cox's party returns to Italy at 
            Trieste (at the time, part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire), then heads west to Venice,
            Verona, and 
            Brescia on the way to Milan and Lake Como, crossing Venetzia and Lombardy. In Trieste,
            we 
            are reminded again of the tumultuous history of mid-century Europe: "Germans &amp; 
            Italians, Russian Soldiers &amp; Austrian, peasants &amp; merchants, all mingling in the 
            shouts &amp; Joy of a Sunday night." At Verona, Cox again encounters Europe's nobility:
            
            "The train of the Elector of Saxony &amp; Queen started just before ours. He stopped at
            our 
            Hotel, beat us at the Tower this morng, &amp; is in many respects an energetic fellow."
            
            Throughout these pages, though, Cox focuses on the stuff of travel writing: the people's
            
            dress and occupations, the landscape, architectural details, associations from literature
            
            and art. The party arrives in Lake Como on July 18, 1851. Cox has filled his journal
            and, 
            before beginning a new volume, he takes a moment to reflect on his travels: "How much
            of the 
            round Earth has been seen! What has it bought us? Humility, Charity Kindness &amp; Tenderness,
            
            No, these are plants, which grow in the shade of home, not the sun &amp; air of the World.
            
            It is to be hoped that the gentler virtues &amp; the primal duties will be better 
            cultivated hereafter in our own homes." Unfortunately, we do not have the second journal,
            
            but we can follow the rest of the voyage in <cite>A Buckeye Abroad</cite>.

            <p> This edition is the latest in a series of collaboratively produced electronic
               editions of previously unpublished nineteenth-century American manuscripts held in
               the Rare Books and Manuscripts Library at The Ohio State University. Previous editions
               include "My Dear
               Elizabeth," five letters written by Sophia Peabody Hawthorne to her sister
               Elizabeth Palmer Peabody between ca. 1837 and 1868 (currently being revised), and
               "Dear
               Wife," twenty-one letters written by riverboat captain William B. Anderson to
               his wife Louisa while he plied the Ohio river during the height of the American Civil
               War, 1862–1864. These documentary editions are intended to provide wide exposure and
               access
               to manuscripts that might otherwise be difficult for scholars to discover and consult,
               and to provide users with a variety of tools for studying those texts.

            <p>
               Each text was edited in connection with an undergraduate or graduate course offered
               by
               H. Lewis Ulman, Associate Professor of English at The Ohio State University. The courses
               aim to provide students with an opportunity to explore issues of textuality and mediation
               that arise when
               our cultural archives spread from page to screen and from library shelves to networked
               databases.
               Electronic textual editing is our vehicle for examining what happens—and envisioning
               what
               might happen—when artifacts in one medium are represented in another medium, especially
               with
               regard to the interpretive work of reading. Electronic textual editions also provide
               a contact zone that
               can help us reflect on what manuscript, print, and "born digital" artifacts can tell
               us about
               their relationships to one another and their unique properties.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               While providing a reliable textual edition is a <i>sine qua non</i>, the Cox
               edition also explores ways of telling four stories inextricably woven into our work:
               the lives and
               historical milieu evoked by the texts, the history of the physical journal (including
               its recent
               restoration), the editorial process that gave rise to this particular interpretation
               of the text,
               and the mediation of our electronic delivery system.

         <p>
            Samuel Sullivan Cox's "Journal of a Tour to Europe" is a leather-bound
            notebook approximately 6.5 in. (16.5 cm.) tall by 4 in. (10 cm.) wide. Its pages
            are unlined and unnumbered. A label in the upper left-hand corner of the paste-down
            endpaper inside the front
            cover indicates that the notebook was "Sold by / Wm. W. Rose / Stationer. / 19 Wall
            St. N.Y."
            The following text is scratched into the outside of the original front cover:
            "S. Cox / Zanesville / Ohio / (U.S.A.)"
            
         </p>
         
         <p>
            When acquired by the Ohio State University Libraries in 2005, Cox's
            journal was in very delicate condition. Its leather
            binding was cracked and peeled, the spine was missing, the stitching was so loose
            that the text block was in
            danger of falling apart, and several leaves had become separated from their conjugates
            or completely loose.
            Before the pages of the journal were scanned for this edition, the journal was disbound
            and the gatherings
            repaired by Harry Campbell, Book and Paper Conservator with the Conservation Division
            of The Ohio State
            University Libraries. Once scanning was complete, the volume was resewn and rebound.
            The original boards,
            binding, and sewing supports were retained and are boxed with the restored journal.
            
         </p>
         
         <p>
            The state of the original volume makes complete description conjectural, but the following
            comparison
            between the orginal and restored volumes will help users relate the page images contained
            in this
            edition to the two states of the journal.
            
         </p>
         
         <p>
            <strong>Original</strong>. The front endpapers may have consisted of four leaves as follows: the paste-down
            
            endpaper, two conjugate leaves, and (conjecturally) a missing flyleaf or stub, all
            forming 
            a separate section at the front. The text block proper was a straightforward 
            16º: [A-H]10; 80 leaves. The back endpapers may have consisted of the paste-down endpaper
            
            and (conjecturally) a missing flyleaf or stub.
            
         </p>
         
         <p>
            <strong>Restored</strong>. The front endpapers consist of the original paste-down endpaper with the inside
            
            hinge area reinforced with sympathetic repair tissue. The text block is 
            16º: [A]12 (+A1.2) [B-H]10; 82 leaves. The back endpapers consist of the original
            paste-down 
            endpaper with the inside hinge area reinforced by sympathetic repair tissue.
            
         </p>
         
         <p>
            The journal is written mostly in brown ink on off-white paper that has taken on a
            bluish tint over time.
            When at sea, Cox often wrote first in pencil, then at some later time traced over
            his text in ink,
            perhaps to avoid spilling or smearing ink when the seas were rough. In most places
            where this overwriting 
            occurs, it closely follows and all but obscures the pencilled text. Where the texts
            diverge, the differences
            typically consist of changes to line breaks or punctuation that do not alter meaning.
            Nevertheless,
            in order to reflect this unique palimpsest-like character of the text, we encode passages
            consisting of both 
            pencil and ink versions in which differences are legible. For those cases, a button in the right margin allows readers to toggle between the
            two versions.

         <h3>Editorial Method</h3>
         
         <p>
            <strong>Scanning</strong>. The manuscript pages were scanned as 24-bit TIFF images
            at 400 dots per inch (dpi), then coverted to 8-bit JPEG images at 400 dpi and full
            quality before being loaded into the Media Manager application. All edges were
            overscanned by at least 1/4 inch. No color correction was used at any stage of image
            preparation, but a scan of a photographer's 18% grey card on the same scanner
            produced RGB values at the center of 91/95/107 after applying a 150% Gaussian Blur
            in
            Adobe Photoshop to average color values. Thus, a properly configured monitor should
            provide a reasonable approximation of colors on the manuscript pages. The pages were
            scanned while the original journal was disbound for restoration. As a result, the
            page images contain penciled page numbers in the lower left- or right-hand corners.
            The numbers were erased after the volume was reassembled and rebound.

            <strong>Markup and Annotation</strong>.
            This transcription of Cox's journal is marked up according to a set of project
            guidelines derived from the Text Encoding Initiative's P4 version of its <cite>Guidelines</cite>. See below for an overview of the project's markup
            conventions and a link to detailed project guidelines. Annotations are limited to
            the
            following categories: 1)&nbsp;comments about the text that supplement the TEI markup;
            2)&nbsp;biographical notes about Cox's party and acquaintances (we do not annotate persons
            easily identified using standard biographical dictionaries); 3)&nbsp;references to
            literary texts; 4)&nbsp;ships mentioned in the text; 5)&nbsp;references to further information
            about journal entries available in <cite>A Buckeye Abroad</cite>.
            
         </p>
         
         <p>
            <strong>Proofing</strong>. After all markup of the text was completed, a team
            member who was not involved in the original markup read the text aloud to the
            principal editor, who checked the marked-up transcript. In addition, the
            HTML pages produced by XSL transformations were proofed for anomalies introduced by
            the transformations.

         <h3>Encoding Conventions</h3>
         
         <p>
            <strong>Markup of Physical Structure and Page Layout</strong>. The manuscript <strong>pages</strong>,
            encoded by the empty page break or &lt;pb/&gt; element, are the primary
            physical structures represented in the markup. Each &lt;pb&gt; element
            includes an "mmid" attribute identifying the unique ID of a
            high-resolution scan of that image in the Media Manager application. <strong>Line breaks</strong>
            (i.e., lineation determined or influenced by the physical constraints of the page
            rather than compositional choices by the author) are encoded with the empty
            &lt;lb/&gt; element. No attributes are included in the &lt;lb&gt;
            element. 
            
         </p>
         
         <p>
            <strong>Markup of Textual Structure</strong>. The <strong>journal
               entry</strong>, encoded by a &lt;div1&gt; element with the attribute-value
            pair "type='Entry'", constitutes the primary textual structure
            represented in the markup. Each entry contains an &lt;opener&gt;
            element—which in turn contains a &lt;dateline&gt; element—and one
            or more paragraphs. Each dateline may include a &lt;name&gt; element with
            (optionally) a "type" attribute containing one of the following
            values: city, region; and a &lt;date&gt; element with a
            "value" attribute whose value is in the form YYYY-MM-DD.
         </p>
         
         <p>Entries consist of a series of <strong>paragraphs</strong>. Where
            indicated by indentation of a line from the left margin of a page, line breaks
            part-way across a page, or additional white space between lines, paragraphs are
            encoded with the &lt;p&gt; element and no attributes.
            
         </p>
         
         <p>If present, any
            prefatory text preceding the dateline may be encoded as a &lt;head&gt;
            element at the beginning of the entry (i.e., within the &lt;div&gt;element
            and before the &lt;opener&gt;). 
            
         </p>
         
         <p> <strong>Level of Transcription/Encoding</strong>. This markup
            scheme supports a modest range of presentations, from semi-modernized/corrected to
            semi-diplomatic. The basic transcription follows the manuscript verbatim. Various
            manuscript features (e.g., cancellations, interlinear or marginal additions, tears
            in
            pages) are encoded, as are regularized versions of proper names and dates and
            standard versions of nonstandard spellings and expansions of abbreviations.
            
         </p>
         
         <p>
            <strong>Extensions to the TEI DTD</strong>. While the markup for this edition
            follows, for the most part, the TEI P4 DTD, various extensions listed in the DOCTYPE
            declaration at the beginning of the core TEI XML-compliant transcript of Cox's
            journal (SSCoxJournal.xml) facilitate inclusion of external digital files. The "mmid"
            attribute added to the &lt;pb&gt; element identifies the unique item
            identifier of images stored in the Media Manager application hosted by the Colleges
            of Arts and Sciences at The Ohio State University.
            The project's Web site contains complete markup guidelines.

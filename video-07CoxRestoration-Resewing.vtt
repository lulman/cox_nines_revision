00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
This is the beginning of the sewing.

2
00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.560
I have gone through this section,

3
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.440
the first section, 

4
00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.730
and erased the pencil marks

5
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.730
that I had put down for page numbers,

6
00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.600
and I will do that with each section

7
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.650
before I sew it on.

8
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.440
I'm going to sew through the original sewing holes

9
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.900
very much like it was sewn originally,

10
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.730
and instead of on vellum sewing supports,

11
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.270
I'm using linen sewing supports,

12
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.730
and I've got them set up on the sewing frame

13
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:36.600
so that they are lined up

14
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.480
with the original sewing stations.

15
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.730
So first of all,

16
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:50.688
I will find the center fold of this section,

17
00:00:50.708 --> 00:00:50.770


18
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.520
line it up with the sewing tapes.

19
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.020
And I'm going to put a weight on here

20
00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.100
so that it doesn't move around.

21
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.980
I am going to lace this thread

22
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.480
-this is a linen thread-which I've got . . .

23
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.270
I've already got it waxed.

24
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.480
I've got it on a needle here.

25
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.190
I've just got it laced through the needle.

26
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.310
I'm going to lock it on right now

27
00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:19.810
by spreading the twist out

28
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.310
and pushing the needle through the twist

29
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.650
and then just pulling it back.

30
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.310
That locks it in place

31
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.400
so that the needle doesn't fall off a lot.

32
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.520
Now I'm going to start the sewing

33
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:42.310
where the original sewing began.

34
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:48.940
First I will pierce a hole from the inside,

35
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:49.900
but then I will put the needle

36
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.360
through that hole from the outside,

37
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.270
and that is the beginning

38
00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:05.272
of the sewing right there.

39
00:02:05.292 --> 00:02:06.230


40
00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.860
Now I will leave a little bit of a tail

41
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.360
out here so that I can tie off onto that

42
00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:21.020
when I get to the end of the next signature.

43
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.600
Is this okay, turning it this way?

44
00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.150
You can see this okay?

45
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.690
What I'm doing? Okay.

46
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.270
So now I'm going to sew through the center fold

47
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.020
so that the sewing will go on the outside

48
00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:42.980
around these supports here.

49
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:52.980


50
00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:02.980


51
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:12.980


52
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.730


53
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.730
Sometimes it is a little bit of a struggle

54
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.860
to get the needle through with the knot,

55
00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.020
through those holes.

56
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.560
And I am making sure that the thread is snug.

57
00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:42.563
I don't want to pull it too tight.

58
00:03:42.583 --> 00:03:52.563


59
00:03:52.583 --> 00:04:02.563


60
00:04:02.583 --> 00:04:12.563


61
00:04:12.583 --> 00:04:22.310


62
00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:23.270
As I come in the inside,

63
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:24.560
I just make sure that I'm pulling it tight,

64
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.940
that it's tightening up 

65
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:37.897
around the sewing supports here.

66
00:04:37.917 --> 00:04:47.897


67
00:04:47.917 --> 00:04:57.897


68
00:04:57.917 --> 00:05:05.190


69
00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.600
I'll take this weight off.

70
00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:10.688
Go to the next signature.

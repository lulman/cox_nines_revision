                Sick to day, but able to be 
                about. Dont think this Kind
                of sea sickness so bad. Philo

                was about more or less all
                day—went to bed early &amp;
                slept sound. Julia pretty
                sick. I had to keep on deck to
                day—or give in.

                When I was first sea sick,
                Philo asked me if I would take
                a passage back in a fishing
                smack from Newfoundland—
               <q>"Pshaw!"</q> said I, indignantly
                at the suggestion of want of
                pluck; but—a sort of hankering after the steady hills of
                Zanesville's vicinity floated, all
                green &amp; flowery, with visions
                of <span class="sic">carpetted[sic]</span> rooms, snug fires
                and easy dressing gowns and

                over again rather be accounted
                <em>pluck</em>less. Such is human
                nature.—Columbus was
                a hero! I have put him up

               seemingly
                exhausted; yet still flying
                in its own element. What a
                lesson does the aerial pilgrim
                teach us. We who are continually
                passing the limits of worldly
                wisdom, and striving for the
                unknown yet <span class="sic">unapproachbly[sic]</span>
                guarded mysteries of God and
                the spirit world—does it not
                teach us to be content in our
                own sphere of Knowledge.
                How beautiful would be the

                a hymn to its Creator, would go

                wing &amp; panting breast, contending
                with harsh cold blasts, just able
                to overtop the snow spray of the

                the mysteries of the Unknown,
                a thing of song in a sea
                of Chaos—soon to [be]  whelmed forever! Is it not an epitome

                A week afloat—To night at
                10 o'clock I resume my journal.
                The vessel rolls with diminished
                Coal-ballast. The sailors sing
                merrilly as they tug at the ropes.
                Philo &amp; Lucy are above. I
                have just left Julia in her
                <span class="sic">birth[sic]</span>, where we have had a
                good conversional time. Lucy
                has just joined her. Since Monday have been pretty well over
                the sea sickness; only so lightheaded that I couldn't sit
                up. Was on deck yesterday
                &amp; today. Descried a solitary
                vessel to the South.  Have filled
                or killed Time in reading Scott
                novels—<cite>Black Dwarf</cite> and
                <cite>old Mortality</cite>. Julia is
                reading them after me—

            <p>
                Have just ordered a bottle
                of hot water for Julia's feet.
                These boats are cold—not
                much danger from fire—
                We shall soon be in <em>Liver</em><em>pool</em>. How liquidly the
                name will melt in the
                mouth. This relief to the
                Atlantic and <em>ourselves</em>
                will be relieved. Philo
                returns. It is time to
                be abed. Won't be in
                Liverpoool till 9 o'clock
                Saturday, on account of
                the tide—Wind's in our teeth.
                Well, <em>we hope for</em> the best —

                pleases me most from its perfect <span class="sic">geomotry[sic]</span> or its vast extent.
                The waverings of the water are
                softened in the distance. It seems
                as if God from the center of the

                depths where the hydraulic pressure
                prevents further gravity, we would
                see "whole navies" and argosies
                rich with the spoils of Time—
                floating or lying <em>perdu</em>.

            <p>
                The sea as you approach
                the horizon's edge grows more
                darkling, until upon its rim
               
               
               
               
               
                where it clasps the sky, it is black.
                Whether this is the result of the
                contrast between the bright
                heaven and the dark sea, or
                whether it is the result of the
                perspective I will not say. Of
                both perhaps.

                What an infinity of angles
                the wind makes the sea 
                make! Like the agitation of
                one overmastering Thought
                upon a world of Mind. Each
                mental medium reflects it
                similiarly yet with its <em>marked</em>
                difference. One, like a Bacon
                or Newton rises with it, to the
                very dome of heaven, flashing
                it white and beautiful in the 
                Day. Its very foam displaying
                the strength of the wave! Another receives the power, &amp; with
                the docility of a child,  [protends?] 
               
               
               
               
               
                its tiny drop—it may be but a 
                drop from the spray of a
                greater billow! — Resistance,
                like our gallant steamer, only serves to make the waves
                rise higher, lashing into snow
                wreaths the black mass, just
                as suffering educe out of the
                poetic soul those "lillies of
                the Sea" which forever adorn
                our world.—

                Vulcan &amp; Neptune both
                own the Asia. You can see
                them now both in the rigging.
                One fixing the rigging with his
                hammer, enveloped in the
                smoke of the huge pipe; the
                other attending the ropes—Wind
                &amp; Fire both harnessed in this

                for he goes despite the Wind!

                Not yet in sight of land, expecting
                to see "Swate Ireland" to night,
                before the Sun dips his murky

                The passage is becoming more

                Was on deck <span class="sic">to day[sic]</span>. As we
                approach G. Brit, the Divinity
                of Drizzle, which rules the Isle,
                has begun to show her power.
                Went to the bow, watched the white
                foam boil under our velocity.
                The Sailors were getting out
                the anchor cables, with a jolly
                song.  We have come only about
                3125 miles — the direct route is
                about 3400 — We save the difference, altho' we make two sides
                of the triangle—because, our
                world is round.

                The Officers are accustomed
                every log to drop a bucket &amp;
                take the temperature of the
                water. These reports are sent
               
               
               
               
               
                perhaps to Greenwich; and there 
                are generalized into vital principles of Navigation. So much
                from a bucket of water and
                Bacon's Induction!

                All on the look out for land.
                Man at the mast head &amp;

                the home of our <span class="sic">infranchisement[sic]</span> draweth nigh!

            <p>
                At about seven PM went on deck.
                It was raining. I clambered up by
                a tarred rope to look over, — when
                horror of horrors! we were within
                25 yards of a huge black rock —
                rising out of the sea like the back
                of Leviathan! I involuntarily drew
                down. We were in sight of land.
                The rock lies a few miles from
                Cape Clear. The night was rainy—
                The <span class="sic">light houses[sic]</span> could however
               
               
               
               
               
                be distinguished. We did not
                retire till nearly 12. The only misgivings I have had since we
                ventured on the sea, was upon
                retiring; but Tired Nature soon
                yielded, and I slept to awake 
                about 8 AM of

                Land in sight. We are running
                along the coast of Ireland, &amp;
                rapidly approaching Liverpool,
                passed the Cork coast in the night.
                The tide will be against us. At
                this time we have passed Cansore
                Point, Ireland; &amp; are pushing up
                the channel between Wales &amp;
                Ireland, not far from sight
                of Braichen point; The Officer
                by my side who is guiding our
                noble ship, says that we are
                moving in a direct line to
                <span class="sic">Holyhed[sic]</span>.  So that we cannot
               
               
               
               
               
                be out of sight of land at any time. The
                land visible in Ireland, is not the
                coast, but the mountains. "Heavy a
                port" says the officer, &amp; the deflection
                Eastward continues.—

            Saturday, May 17, 1851.
            
            
            <p>
                Since writing the above, we
                have run into the Sight
                of England. I observed an
                oval line of fineness delicate
                and fibre thin, to our right.
                It grew into form, vast and
                palpable, until Holyhead,
                <span class="sic">Anglesea[sic]</span>, burst on us. It looked
                the rock bound coast, we read
                of. The rocks are all fissured
                and grey as geese with salt.
                No footing for landing—

            <p>
                The rocks impress one strangely.
                We saw a beautiful little
                bridge (not the Menai)

                lead
                up to one of the outer rocks
               
               
               
               
               
                We saw the piles &amp; place for
                the new harbour at Holyhead
                for the Cunard line. The tide
                was strong against us; &amp;
                yet continues. We took a pilot
                aboard, who gave us a newspaper, which was devoured by
                14 at once. We are now (10 PM)
                under his convoy. The boat
                reels from side to side. The
                cries of "Starboard" &amp; "steady" ring
                from the prow to the tiller.
                And this is England! Glorious
                old England, with all her 
                <span class="sic">reccollections[sic]</span> so glorious.

                We reached Liverpool last night
                about 11. How I can describe my               
                feelings at the grand illumination
                which flanked us up the Mersey. I would
                liked to have seen the green—bright green
                of the banks with their white cottages &amp;
                elegant residences; but no! a richer 
                treat was afforded. The Mersey looks
                to be a mile wide, &amp; as we approached
                Liverpool the gas lights played like fairies
                about us. The huge docks of Birkenhead
                looked dark and gloomy as we passed.  
                They allow no fire about them. Fires
                are rare here. As we would come
                in range of one of the fine streets of 
                Liverpool the lights would form
                a regiment of fires, extending the
                perspective so finely! The vessel could
                not be docked. The tide running out
                So we had to go off on a lighter or
                young ferry. Such a time, in passing
                valices, through the Custom House hands
                Were in hopes to have got off trunks too,
                but failed. Paid servants, bid Asia 
                good bye, and walked the plank
               
               
               
               
               
                Made the  acquaintance of M<sup>r</sup> Wallen
                of Florence, who will be useful. Our
                passengers that are worth remembering
                are  M<sup>r</sup> Kelley &amp; 
               some Phila. men,

                Next came the hurrah &amp; exquisite
                delight of landing. We touched the
                dock: &amp; I fairly capered.  Philo
                looked after  Lucys trunk, I after
                the ladies. We were first accosted by
                the veritable  <em>O. Twist</em>,  
               who in his tatters
                and with a bow &amp; a touch of an <span class="sic">apochryphal[sic]</span> cap, requested to carry the carpet
                bag. After inquiring after  M<sup>r</sup> Twist,
                a police man with a long hat &amp; a
                N<sup>r</sup> on his collar, touched 
                Oliver, when he
                mysteriously <span class="sic">vamosed[sic]</span>. Next came was 
                a <em>liar</em>, s'<sup>d</sup>, he was servant at 
               Waterloo,
                &amp; as we preferred walking to the Hotel
                he assumed the guide. Suspected he was
                lying, and asked an officer, who s'd
                he was a <em>servant</em>. Soon came upon
                another liar. "Waterloo Sir?:"— Sorry
                it's full Sir, I am boots there" Sir,
                Three ships just in.  [hrs?]  —

                Suspicious—moved on; the streets
                looked so prim &amp; neat. The houses
                high &amp; dark. S<sup>t</sup> Somebody's church
                illumined showed &amp; struck 2
               
               
               
               
               
                in the morning. Cabs (one horse hasty
                neat vehicles) rolled by over the
                splendid paves. Policemen watched.
                Our guide trotted along; girls in
                a titter at the wild romance of
                the nocturnal promenade.

                ready to usher us in—took our names,
                Julia ordered rooms, &amp; soon we
                were so cosily fixed.

                long in breaking. Slept till 11. It 
                was so nice to take coffee &amp; tea

                After writing all day, at 1/2 5 P.M.
                all sallied out to see this commercial
                metropolis. We first were accosted [by] 
                two little vagrant girls or boys (could
                not tell  which,) they were dressed with
                two rags a piece. One of them piloted
                P. &amp; L. some squares, muttering like
                a little gipsy, making a perfect
                fretification come over us strange
                people. Soon we got into the region
                of splendid residences. The Corinthian
                elegance of the architecture here &amp;
                the neatness &amp; well pavedness of  the
                streets are prominent. The next thing is
                the foliage. We went apast an enclosure all leafy &amp; laid out in walks—
               a square, apparently public, but
                with only a Summer house in it. A       
                full <span class="sic">quoir[sic]</span> of birds were sing a Sabbath
                Anthem. Long iron bars were for fences.
                We went west, apast such a bevy
                of beautiful residences. Trees in front
                &amp; birds all about. Every house seemed
                a Sister of the other. A beautiful Gothic
                Chapel attracted our eye. The Bishop
                of Chester was advertised to preach.
                We went farther down apast what 
                seemed the RR. Depot &amp; Exchange.
               
               
               
               
               
                Both are magnificent pieces of architecture. The Corinthian is predominant. The capitals have so much
                Elegant tracery. Passed a street
                called "Roscoe,"
               <a name="pRoscoehist" class="notePointer"></a><a href="#nRoscoehist" class="annotation" title="This street was named after William Roscoe (1783-1851), who was a Liverpool lawyer, historian, writer and philanthropist."><sup class="noteAnchor">23</sup></a> 
               after the celebrated
                Historian of the Medici. It recalled his name &amp; Irving's Eloquent

                Next came the Docks,
                which we reached by passing thro'
                a grave yard, over grave stones,
                which no one seems to mind here—
                (horrible!) It was the grave 
                yard of a Solitary Chapel, upon 
                the side hill. Soon we saw the
                shipping, with the  "Washington,"
                &amp; Gen Washingtons figure at the 
                head — Then following the rush 
                of people, saw the ferries leave for
                the different points. Quite a 
                crowd were upon the quays. We
                saw the docks. They were full of
                water floating their masses of
                timber &amp; forests of masts, altho' it
                was low tide. It brings the shipping away from the river, into
                the city. The water was rushing
                at a great rate into the Mersey
                from them. Turning up we
                <span class="sic">past[sic]</span> Maltese Sailors &amp; all sorts
               
               
               
               
               
                On our way up, we saw another
                Church, with its grave stones all
                bowed (as if ashamed) at the desecration done to them by making
                them a pavé. Returned to the
                Waterloo, wearied; the ladies complain of having been stared at
                mildy— We saw the 'Adelphi'
                It is an ex <span class="sic">elegent[sic]</span> Hotel. But 
                I like ours.—

                When does the day end here
                It was light enough to write here
                at 3 AM &amp; now I am closing
                this at 20m at 9.—

            <br>On the cars at Stafford,
            Monday after 12:
            
            
            
            <p>
               We are temporarily stopped.
                Boys are crying the ""Times,"—"M<sup>r</sup> Wallen
                who is with us in the car, is reading from
                the "'times'"—The country which we have
                passed through, has been one perfect
                succession of rural beauties. After
                leaving Liverpool, we walked around
                to the rail way,— I got my life insured
                for 3d. during our trip!

            <p>
                The tunnel out of Liverpool, is 1 1/4
                mile, through the solid rock. We
                moved over an inclined plane; by force
                of a stationary engine. As soon as
                we emerged, into the open air, every
                eye opened at the perfect neatness
                refreshing greenish green of the
               
               
               
               
               
                nicely carpeted meadows.— We are
                now moving away, still in sight of
                a beautiful tower upon the hill at
                our left. The peculiar chimneys &amp;
                the very red bricks of the houses, give
                Stafford an air of rural comfort, only
                equalled by every other part of this magnificent country. Nature seems as
                if just washed in a shower, and so
                bright, almost yellow in the green that
                it pleases the eye strangely. The
                churches, are mostly Gothic, and
                peeping from amid the clump of
                leafiness. I no longer wonder at the
                love of rural life, the love of gardens
                and meadows and walks &amp; woods, &amp;
                parterres &amp; terraces, so often the subject
                of the English pastoral. The meads were
                literally embroidered with butter cups, so
                yellow, &amp; daisies so white; while all along
                our way we were lined with the hawthorn
                hedges. Oh! those exquisite hedges, so
                neat &amp; trim, &amp; green; parting neat fields
               
               
               
               
               
                from their sister meads,—fields dotted with
                the unwanted saffron furze, and silvered
                along with little streams, to the very
                edge of which the carpets of grass
                extended. The hills were dotted all
                over with the purest fleeces of
                South downs; and the plains were
                all spotted with the spotted Durham
                cattle. Perfect pictures of pastoral
                repose! Some of the fields were blue as
                the sky with pansies. The cottages, how
                many of them, were all ivied over, except
                the high thatched roofs of slate or straw.
                The land was of a reddish tinge, until
                as we approached London,—near Layton,
                a chalk formation appeared. Our agriculturist P. was perfectly struck
                dumb at what Art had done for
                Nature here so naturally sterile.
                The common roads were all bound in with
                with the green hedge &amp; seemed as
                smooth as winding garden paths. Indeed the whole sweep of the country,
                is one vast panorama of gardens.
                The fields are deeply furrowed—those
                for grain &amp; with such exactitude as
                give the appearance of taste and
                heed to Every part! Nature seems 
                as if swept by the care of her children. Not a sign of poverty. The
               
               
               
               
               
                manufacturing districts all seemed so
                neat—Then long high chimney stacks
                lifting themselves out of the level
                land and at their top, tipped
                with wavy streamers of smoke.
                Yet even about the manufactories
                is this same rural love. Each
                railway station is a little Paradise
                of Beauty. Grounds laid off so regularly. There does not seem to be a
                <em>sloven</em> in all the land. Poverty as
                I said, does not appear. Agriculture
                is certainly not depressed here, for
                every inch of land is taken. If 4
                times as much is imported as
                formerly &amp; consumed, &amp; they raise
                more than they used to, has not
                the Free Trade theory Done much!
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The most noticeable object was
                a fine Old Tower, upon a hill of
                trees to the right. It commands
                a prospect of the country, &amp; has that
                imposing air which an old castle
                should have.
               
            </p>

               "<em>Gentleman's</em>' houses, ar[e]  distinguished from <span class="sic"><em>farmers</em>[sic]</span>, by the degree of
                taste in the architecture. The science
                of Agriculture seems advanced here
                to its highest perfection!
               
            </p>
            
            
            
            
            
            <p>
                Altogether we were gloriously animated, declaring that never thro' 
                our minds passed so many
                examples of Beauty. It was like
                a succession of landscapes in 
                a gallery, each "picked "
                out for an example of the best."
                Soon I descried the valley of the
                "royal toward <span class="sic">Thame[sic]</span>"—its towers looming up and its splendid residences all
                embowered as it were in a green setting
                by a silver marge. Soon we came into
                a Depot flanked on either side by splendid
                residences &amp; fine  [grassed?]  plats. Singing
                birds all around us. A cab soon
                brought us wondering into famous
                London town, where at N<sup>o</sup> 13

                 [9?]  P.M. have returned, saw the immense
                and glorious structure &amp; what is more, its
                multiform and splendid contents. Have
                been on foot ever since we left, looking
                only through a part of the palace—and such
                an array of 'diamond &amp; gold'—India's riches,
                <span class="sic">Frenich[sic]</span> elegance—German ingenuity, Italian
               
               
               
                
                taste—American skill,—Turkish luxury
                African oddity, &amp; in fact, every imaginable
                refinement—never was before put into
                one place. It is the World's <span class="sic">bizarre[sic]</span>.
                All of us were so agreeably disappointed.
                The arrangement was only equalled by
                the things arranged—Statuary, carpets,
                bronze, fountains, trees, pagodas, Architecture—Indian rooms, Equestrian 
                statuary—all spread out into such
                beauty. It was filled with the moving
                mass.—Not disappointed in a thing!
                the palace itself is a wonder; the
                contents, more wonderful!
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We got tired at 5 1/2—hired a cab,
                came down apast Green Park; Saw
                S<sup>t</sup> James park in the distance,
                the palace with the flag flying! As
                we turned up out of Bond into Oxford Street; Lo! a couple of outriders
                dressed in red,—then a carriage
                drawn by 6 horses with red riders;
                then came two other riders with out livery;
                then came two other red fellows with
                canes, who looked so savage at a
                hack driver, that didn't give way
                immediately.  Pretty soon, we saw
                hats go off—Hurrah! it's the Queen!
                I noticed her as they passed, but did
                not observe anything ordinary—The
                little boy was dressed nicely, with a
               
               
               
               
               
                silver laced cap—A pretty little girl
                sat with him in the front seat; &amp;
                a lady &amp; somebody sat back. I asked
                the driver if it was the Queen, he said
                Yes—"Drive after them!" Away went
                the sovereign of G<sup>t</sup> B. Away after
                went us Sovereigns in chase. The
                outriders did not look savage at
                us; &amp; we got pretty close. Whereupon
                to our open Eyes and outstretched
                necks, the Queen herself
                turned round &amp; gave us a
                good look &amp; full view. We
                had quite a good laugh at
                our good fortune; came home full
                of the Exhibition &amp; of Royalty.

               What an Eventful day! Never
                before in <em>my life</em> has there been such

               the
                Crystal palace day—My brain is 
                almost dizzy with the splendors &amp;
                ingenuity of this Industrious World.
                No wonder men labor, when <em>such</em>

                Upon going up to day to the Exhibition
                we passed the famous house of Duke
                of Wellington, 'Apsley House'. I knew
                it by the great bronze equestrian
                statue of the Iron Duke. We also
                saw on our return William Pitt, at
                Hanover Sq. in full length with the 
                Scroll of Empire in his hand. What a
                lofty bearing he had.

                On the road to the great
                Derby.—We started at 1/2 past 9.
                Came down apast the statue of George
                Canning, a splendid figure. Passed
                Trafalgar Square, where we saw the
                great Nelson monument, as well as the 
                monuments of Geo III &amp;IV. The Nelson
                monument has a very high shaft—

            <p>
                and a carving of the Battle of the Nile
                upon the side next us. Soon we came 
                in sight of Old Westminster Abbey,
                black &amp; streaked, but full of interest
                with its turrets, niches, tracery, towers,
               <q>"a wilderness of building."—</q>

                over Vauxhall bridge, and were soon
                in the pell mell, dashing hurrah
                route to the Derby,—What a close
                time we had. When 15 miles from
                Epsom we were compelled to walk.
                And even stand still. Every kind
                of vehicle from a dog cart to the 
                 [Prussian?]  royal carriage, with cream
                colored horses, was on the road.
                Never had such a time. Lucy timid—
                Julia <em>sangfroid.</em> 
               Lord Strathmore
                ran bump against us. At last
                after passing through glorious roads
                adorned with hedges, &amp; beauteous
                vistas, with a prospect from Epsom
                downs over a vast range of variegated yet beautiful country, we came
                in sight of the stand. The downs
                are covered with furze. With shouts
                &amp; laughter &amp; hurrah! all hands dash
                in on the turf. What a Scene! Who

                is to be run for by 33 horses. At
                least a half a million are on the 
                ground. The hack cleared, the cry is
               <q>they're off.</q>—Away they dash!

            <p> Crowds, shouts, pigeons off. Such
                a rush. Gipsies, circus, cries,
                vendors—a regular tournament; a
                fuss with a mean English puppy, who
                insulted the ladies,—a drive thro'
                a beautiful country with it's vistas 
                of trees, ivies, and flowery <span class="sic">carpetted[sic]</span>
                meadows; and then through crowds
                packed close over Westminster
                home!—Tired enough I wrote to
               Medary &amp; father, then went to bed

                is yet to be written out. The wonder

                Was suprised at the Scene.
                The hats of Members on—the

                The House of Commons having again resolved itself into a committee upon the Ecclesiastical Titles' 
                Assumption Bill,
                                 
                Mr. T. Duncombe
               moved that the first clause be 
                postponed until the House was in possession of a 
                copy of the brief, rescript, or letters apostolical
                upon which the enactment contained in that clause 
                was founded.  It was not unreasonable, he thought,
                that prior to ex-post facto legislation, inflicting pains
                and penalties and annulling rights, this document
                should be produced.
                                 
                The Solicitor-General opposed the motion,
                arguing that the legislation would be founded, not
                upon the rescript, but upon the notorious fact declared in the preamble, that divers of 
               Her Majesty's Roman Catholic subjects had assumed certain
                titles of pretended sees in the United Kingdom, 
                under colour of an alleged authority given to them
                for that purpose by a certain brief, rescript, or letters apostolical from the See of Rome. 
                                 
                The motion, which was supported by Mr. ROEBUCK, Mr. KEOGH, and Mr. REYNOLDS, and opposed
                by the ATTORNEY-GENERAL and 
               Mr. WALPOLE, was 
                negatived on a division by 221 against 49.
                                 
                On the first clause,
                                 
                 Sir F.THESIGER moved, 
               instead of the words
                <q>" the said brief, &amp;c.,"</q> to insert the words <q>"all such
                   briefs, &amp;c.,"</q>  intending to move corresponding 
                amendments in the preamble; his object being, he
                said, to comprehend all similar rescripts which may
                have been issued prior to the bill within the terms 
                of the declaratory enactment contained in this
                clause.
                                 
               
               
               
               
                                 
                The SOLICITOR-GENERAL thought Sir Frederick
                had misconceived the scope and tendency of the 
                clause, which was not intended to revive the Statute
                of Præmunire, which was unnecessary, but, in deference to the opinion of Mr.Walpole, to make a 
                public and solemn declaration with reference to an 
                act of violence and aggression by a foreign potentate, whereby certain subjects of the realm had
                assumed certain titles and authority ; though he
                (the SOLICITOR-GENERAL) thought the clause superfluous, in addition to the recital in the preamble, 
                the act being clearly illegal and void.
                                 
               A long discussion ensued, in which the legal construction and effects of the clause and the amendment were very fully considered. At the suggestion of 
               Mr. Henley, 
               Sir F. THESIGER 
               consented to defer
               the motion until the fate of an amendment in the 
               preamble announced  by Mr. WALPOLE, which had a 
               concurrent object, was decided.
                                 
                The Earl of ARUNDEL and SURREY then moved
                another amendment of the first clause, by the insertion of words expressly exempting from its operation
                the use of such jurisdiction or title as shall be necessary for the spiritual purposes, appealing to the avowal 
                of the Government that the bill was not intended 
                to interfere with spiritual functions.
                                 
                The ATTORNEY-GENERAL objected to the amendment, which would involve the inconguity of declaring the rescript, and all jurisdiction conferred
                thereby, unlawful and void, and at the same time
                recognizing its validity for certain purposes.
                                 
                The amendment was supported by Mr. MOORE,
                Mr. KEOGH, and Sir H. BARRON, and opposed by
                 LORD J. RUSSELL.
               On a division it was rejected by 
               316 against 61.
                                 
               Mr. Sa[ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ]

                Was most pleased with Mr
                Walpole as a speaker, Sir Geo
                Gray  
               as a business man; Lord
                John Russell as a shrewd one.

               Chancellor in the lobby. Rec'd
               
               
               
               
               
                information from divers MP's
                as to the Mode of division, persons
                in the House etc..  As to the legal
                men of the government was disappointed not a little. Still they are
                shrewd men: After many ruminations in the old English Parliament,
                &amp; a walk around the 'Abbey,' got 
                in a "Hansom" &amp; came home:
                sick in body; but elevated in Soul.

                After writing till 11, went to the

                gate—had a delicious stroll thro'
                the park; fed swans &amp;<sup>c</sup>. Then
                went into Ex at 12 M. finished
                France &amp; Austria; went to the 
                intricate machine department—
                then through the West galleries, &amp;
                saw sights to live forever.

                wrote my impressions—bid it

                the park, &amp; stopped on the 
                bridge, wrote a description of
                it to Medary: wandered home'
                thro Sussex Place
               &amp; the aristocratic part of London. Ladies  
                had not been out. Stayed at 
                home in Evening. I kept a

                down: the birds were making
                nests in the Abbey. It was cold

                Music &amp; organ swelling. Lord

                saw Godfrey Kneller—; passed thro'
                the old tombs of the Abbots dated

            <br>Dover,
            May 26. 1851.
            
            
            <p>
                Here we are in sight of France.
                Have written to day &amp; last night
                4 long letters, left London at 1 for
               
               
               
               
               
                for Paris. Came down through rolling
                country, by cars. The hills lining
                both sides of the way. Soon the
                white chalky cliffs of Kent came
                into view; and dashing into the
                heart of 'Shakespeare cliff' which
                is tunnelled through; the same
                Cliff where <span class="sic">Gloster[sic]</span> stood; then
                the Sea opened with its boats, &amp;
                the white cliffs of France gleamed in the Sun. Soon Dover bay
                a semi-circular water scene—
                appeared, while the long high
                range of cliffs gleam white, with
                their yellow &amp; green flowers decked
                the white surface. The barracks
                are on the high cliff near our
                '<em>Gun</em> Hotel', We went to the
                base of the hill, went up the stairs
                thro' sentinels to the top. Three
                stairways went up. Upon the
                top, surmounted with  [armour?] , is
               
                              
               
               
               
                a fine green plot; the birds are
                flying &amp; making nests in the
                cliffs. But we strike thro' Dover for the fortifications, ascend by
                long winding steps to the top; &amp;
                are about to enter the gate to the
                big grey  [moss?] -grown towers, when
                "<q>Stand</q>!" &amp; a Soldier challenges
                us for the pass. We were chagrined,
                &amp; after gazing off toward Calais,
                &amp; surveying the hills around, left
                for the beach. Picking up stones
                there, we viewed the front of the
                towers. The solid walls are full
                of iron gates. Little houses, like
                nests, are upon its sides. Subterran [ean?]  caverns enter into the forts, in
                which are trap doors, &amp; places for
                poison. Poor Julia, had a hard
                time to get up the hills; but she
                did do justice to the supper in
                Consequence.            
               
            </p>
            
                                       
            
             
            
            
            <p>
                The ride today has been on a piece
                with all the other travelling into the
                English country,— a rural prospect
                of rare beauty from the Surrey
                to Dover. <span class="sic">Tumbridge[sic]</span> furnished
                a splendid old ivied tower. It looked so fine and hallowed.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So again another tower, ivied of
                course, nearer Dover. But
                Dover eclipses all. We were below the hills, and the people
                on top looked no "larger than
                their heads." It is a splendid
                scene. ⁓ Wrote an account of it.

            Paris;
            Tuesday, May 27.
                                              
            
            
            <p>
                What a time in getting here; How 
                much have we seen! Crossed
                Straits yesterday night in a few 
                hours. We came into Paris at 
                9 A.M; had to stay all day,  [and?]  
                until tomorrow in order to get 
                passports. We visited Champs
               
               
               
                
               
               Elysees, 
               Arc de Triomphe, Notre
                Dame, 
               The Pantheon,  
               rode about 
                in a cab, through the principal 
                streets. Wrote a detail of all 
               to Col. M. — A perfect day of 
               wonders—The Luxembourg above 
                all. The café mode was good.
                Learned to talk Francais considerably with our cabman. My
                proficiency astonished me. Guess
                we can get along thro' France.
                Took at short look at Paris 
                by gaslight; but tired, I retired—
                Next morn'g commenced a letter 
                to Medary; but had to take an 
                early breakfast, so as to be 
                at the Dilligence …

            <br>
            Wednesday Morn'g— 
            <p>We
                left in dilligence—amid tooting &amp;<sup>c</sup>.
                great old things, how they go, &amp;
                rattle. Got on the cars, went
                through Dijon 
               down the Seine                        
               
               
               
               
               
                valley to Chalon. took boat down
               Saône—fine Scenery—all been                        
                described—vineyards, windmills
                donkeys, Lombardys. all; Old
                towers in distance. What a
                time for Supper at our inn!
                What a time talking to the
                women in our diligence!
                Saw Macon—Saw the fine 
                vineyards about it—passed
                amid the splendid Scenery, high
                &amp; lofty near Lyons; passed
                amid old boats, &amp;<sup>c</sup> into Lyons;
                where we again took Dilligence.
                Dumb fellow &amp; soldiers quite an 
                incident. Lyons sits so high in air.
                Next we came before night fall
                apast Lens, where there was a 
                famous Cathedral. Just as the Evening was dying awhile in splendor,
                we passed over a bridge, turned
                around nearly at right angles, and
               
               
               
               
               
                struck the most bewitching scenery I ever viewed. I thought, at 
                first, it must be Vaucluse; but
                no—it was near Vienne
               the ancient capital of the Allobroges. 
               as we 
                afterward learned. Upland slopes 
                all around us—Meadows below—
               beautiful mountains, with vineyards
                terraced &amp; staked up as high as the
                eye can reach; rocks with yellow,
                purple &amp; red flowers, &amp; wild roses
                hanging over the rocks. We met
                plenty of pretty girls on the road. A
                pretty stream of water flowed below
                us, which was used in silk factories
                I suppose. The girls had caps on 
                head &amp; flowers in hand. Groves of 
                Lombardys all about—Far over
                beyond the opposite hill, we saw
                houses carved out of the rocks,— willows surround our path; while 
                flower gardens &amp; vineyards surround splendid residences. These
               
                                         
               
               
                spring up in the bosom of the
                valley, as if by magic. Boys are
                going home from fishing. Furze now &amp;
                then appears &amp; gleams upon the 
                mountains; The stakes upon the
                lofty vineyards seem infinite.
                Soon we pass stone fountains,—and
                all at once, the scene of the "arrowy 
                Rhone,"
               <a name="pArrowyRhone" class="notePointer"></a><a href="#nArrowyRhone" class="annotation" title="From Byron's Childe Harold's Pilgrimage: &#34;Is it not better, then, to be alone, / And love Earth only for its earthly sake? / By the blue rushing of the arrowy Rhone, / Or the pure bosom of its nursing lake, / Which feeds it as a mother who doth make / A fair but froward infant her own care, / Kissing its cries away as these awake-- / Is it not better thus our lives to wear, / Than join the crushing crowd, doom'd to inflict or bear?&#34; (Canto III, stanza 71)."><sup class="noteAnchor">35</sup></a>              
               appears,—Not without first
                passing the Roman tower 76 feet
                high. I knew it was Roman 
                before I turned to my memo.—
                It was in a meadow, near
                the road. How the French run
                their roads. near anything glorious.
                The clouds looked fine &amp; the Sun
                glanced through then in <em>raw</em>
                <em>brilliancy</em>. The radii from the Sun
                as it drew water, looked finely.
                We passed an old tower &amp; a church,
                and stopped at Vienne—Up
                came cripples of all kinds—
               
                                         
               
               
               semi circulars—One legged—whining 
               about while plenty of bread was
               within reach. They actually fought
               to get near our diligence. Soldiers, <span class="sic">cafès[sic]</span>, barracks,⁓We passed
               straw covered <span class="sic">waggons[sic]</span>—Burr mill
               stone factorys— &amp; walls covered
               with white flowers &amp; brown moss.
               A splendid scene after we 
               left Vienne. The pretty little
               houses of the vine dressers speckled the hills; goats hung upon 
               the hill sides, while an old
               chateau loomed up prominent.
               This is the France, with her
               wealth of silk worms &amp; clusters!
               The town of Vienne burned
               like fire in the Sun—We gathered
               flowers at Vienne—pressed them.

            Thursday Morning —
             
            <p>found
               us still in diligence. This is the 
               day of Roman monuments in
               Gaul. After riding &amp; sleeping till
               
                
               
               
               near 9 A.M: I got out upon the 
               front seat of the diligence. What
               strange appearance is that to the
               East.— away off among the hills,
               Can it be solid Earth, with clouds
               below it. "Alp montaigne" says
               our good Conducteur, with whom
               I commenced instructions in English &amp; French. The appearance was 
               beautiful. A long range of mountains 
               some beneath the cloud showed
               themselves all day. As we passed 
               Orange,
               we saw one mountain snow
               topped. It shone finely. Our
               road lay along level country, &amp;
               we entered upon the department
               of Vaucluse, so famous in the
               Songs of the Troubadour. We
               passed crosses hung with chaplets—  
               and auberges with their signs of 
               holly over the door; &amp; soon the 
               old ruins began to appear.
               
                
               
               
               
               The prominent ruin was called chateau de Mont Dragon, some
               30, or 40 miles from Avignon. It
               was a large pallisade, built by 
               nature as a strong hold. The 
               walls run up perpendicularly
               over 175 feet. A wall is built
               upon the hill. Here was a great 
               old Roman place, perhaps one of 
               Caesar's himself. It seems perfectly safe; yet upon the top of it,
               we saw ruined stones, showing
               that even upon Natures battlements, Art had erected its forts.
               The earthen tiled roofs &amp; the 
               willows pass us on our rapid
               way, until Orange gleams in 
               the Sun. Here is a grand Amphitheater of the Romans, and the relic
               ruins of the fortress of the Princes 
               of Orange above it upon the hill
               As we passed on, the Amphitheater 
               seemed nearer,—its concave was 
               
                
               
               
               
               to us &amp; its convex to the hill. It 
               frowned like an old Roman.
               As we passed on, I turned round
               &amp; looked into it. &amp; there saw
               the arranged places. Here was 
               martyred to Wild beasts, the
               prisoners of the Roman. 
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               But see! What splendid 
               arch appears. Now we approach
               it, snakes, shields, battle axes, 
               &amp; figures, all in ruins, yet sufficiently solid while crumbling 
               tell us that Marius was here,
               &amp; that this was his memento 
               of the battle with the Allobroges.                        
               
            </p>                      
            
            <p>
               But we have more marvels in this valley of Beauty. Avignon, our dining place soon appears. The lofty turrets &amp; grey
               old towers of the Bishop's palace
               lifting themselves, as Eloquent
               silent orators of the Past. This
               
               
               
               
               
               is indeed a massive palace—
               worthy of note by the traveller;
               but even that does not distract
               the mind from the high wall
               which with its turrets &amp; towers &amp; moats
               &amp; ornamented, yet decaying, surrounds the beautiful City of 
               Avignon. An old viaduct
               crosses the Rhone here, broken                         
               down in the middle—Its windows &amp; arches look mournful &amp; 
               dead beside the beautiful
               suspension bridge just below. Here
               the old &amp; new civilization is 
               contrasted. Old walls, &amp; the 
               locomotive.⁓! We enter in
               by the diligence to our Hotel
               National. How cool &amp; delicious 
               it seems. The long promenades &amp;
               shady places, together with the 
               best hotel on the Continent, make
               this place one to be remembered.
               
               
               
               
               
               We wished to stay longer; amid
               the strawberries &amp; walls; but the
               cars left at 2: &amp; down we dash 
               toward Marseilles. What towns
               we passed. What olive orchards,
               what black &amp; grey old rocks;
               what vineyards &amp; terraces, we 
               passed before we dashed into the 
               dark long tunnel of at least 
               two miles, through mountains 
               of rocks, are written in memory.
               At last the Mediterranean so 
               blue appeared; and a storm
               of sunshine beauty came up,
               to fling rainbows over our
               heads as we entered Marseilles.
               I saw one arch of the rainbow
               coming out of an old tower;
               but soon it leaped into the
               Mediterranean, &amp; shamed
               the heavens. The air was filled 
               with a rich interpenetrating
               
               
               
               
               
               sunlustre; and the orb went
               down amidst golden bars of
               clouds. Oh! it was a fine 
               scene as we entered Marseilles
               
            </p>  
            
            <p>
               Two things deserve record. 
               Before we reached Avignon,
               the famous castle called the
               Ruins of the chateau des 
               Baron des Adret appeared.
               The castle is towered upon high
               battlements, in which are little 
               portholes. It is guarded well.
               The legend as the conducteur 
               told me, is that the Baron during
               the revolution threw over here, 4 
               of his servants. It is the finest
               ruin yet.⁓

               the tomb of <span class="sic">Petrarch[sic]</span>
               &amp; Laura.
               the fountains are famous in 
               story. We did not see them—

            May 31 / 51.
            
            
            
            <p>
                We stayed here all yesterday
                night—can't get off to Naples
                until tomorrow; have come over
                600 miles from Paris. Here we
                stopped at the Imperial Hotel,
                excellent,—English <span class="sic">servents[sic]</span>—
                Have visited with cabmen,
                the Chateau de fleurs, a
                paradise of Beauty above
                Marseilles. Flowers of every
                hue—beds laid off every way,
                places for amusement &amp; exercise, lakes with swans, hills,
                grottoes, small streams  &amp; fountains,
                circus,—all make this a famous
                resort. The ladies got fine boquets. We
               went yesterday to
                see the Turc cafè. A glittering
                mirror painted finely. We assended a point near the Mediterranean, which overlooked
                the city—we had a fine view
               
               
               
               
               
                of Marseilles. It is a large city.              
                Found some <span class="sic">Moroccos[sic]</span> there. Spoke  
                in French to the "<em>Emperor</em>" with            
                white beard. He offered the American snuff; the American with               
                a "remorse" took a  pinch, &amp;
                when he had got out the "<q>bon
                   jouies"—Sneeze—!Sneeze—!<span class="sic">Sneeeze[sic]</span>—!</q>" to the amusement of              
                Julia &amp; 
               Lucy; &amp; no doubt
                to the amusement of Mahomed.
                Drove down past the theatre, &amp;
                <em>here we are</em>.

            Sunday Morning 1 June 1851.
            
            
            
            <p>
                Still at Marseilles: got up late,
                wrote letters, sent them off:—Just
                got fairly into a letter home when 11
                o clock struck: Forgot to mention that we saw cows going round
                to be milked—also that there [are]  a great
                many splendid promenades here. Also
                that the old fort looks stung and
                nervous. We went down to the
                water's edge on foot; our ladies carrying boquets, we our coats; our 
                little luggage being so Easily disposed
                of. Met our U.S. Consul at the
                boat, or <em>batteau</em>. He was a perfect
                gentleman, more than we can say
                of most Consuls. Mrs. Stephens,
                the Authoress &amp; some other Americans just started from the shore.
                Our boat looked really romantic
                with colored covering. The Sun
                shone finely &amp; somewhat warmly,
               
               
               
               
               
                as we glided away between the
                shipping and apast the other boats.
                Who can believe this is Sunday.
                It seems the busiest day. Only
                chimes are ringing most musically. Soldiers, however, were out
                drums beating ⁓ Our vessel, the
                'Languedoc' looks finely, cleanly.
                We took 1<sup>st</sup> class <span class="sic">births,[sic]</span> 600 fr.
                for all.—

            Monday Morng
            June 2<sup>d</sup>1851.
                           
            
            
            <p>
               We are now gliding
                along the Sardinian coast, which is
                lined with mountains, under which are
                scattered little specs of white, said to
                be towns (interrupted just here by a
                hurrah on board about a school of
                porpoises which our boat woke up—
                great old sea hogs!) Have found
                M<sup>rs</sup> Anne Stephens (the Authoress)
                quite caustically agreeable; &amp; her
                companions Miss 
               and M<sup>r</sup> Pratt (
               
               
               
               
               
                children of Hon Z. Pratt N.Y.) quite
                as pleasant as we could desire.
                On the morning of the 2<sup>d</sup>, we hove
                in sight of Genoa,—a cresent city
                called the Superb. Went ashore
                without difficulty,—stopped at
                the Hotel <em><span class="sic">Des[sic]</span> Londies</em>, a splendid
                palace. Julia said
               '<q>this was just
                   her idea of the old Italian palaces,
                   black &amp; white marble floors.—
                   painted ceilings, rich canopys
                   and outside painted so queer.</q>
                It was all stone—so cool, so
                delightful. After passing from
                the boat we went thro' a motley
                crowd of donkeys, red capped
                men and all sorts—passed
                down "Porticato <span class="sic">all[sic]</span> Piazzo,'
                marble promenade above (See
                engraving. Soldiers about—Women with veils—white &amp;fleecy

                After resting some time, we started
                out—Ladies with Miss Pratt

               went down the narrow streets—                 
                so narrow some of them, you
                could step across; few carriages—
               some donkeys: saw the outside of
                Old Ducal palace,—also the Cathedral Saint Lorenzo. We stayed 
                but a moment. It was of black
                &amp; white marble, paintings fine,
                 [saw?]  old inscription in time of
                Constantine the Great, set
                in the wall. After ranging about
                Exchange &amp; Bank, went down
                Goldsmith's Street, then met our
                Ladies—when we went home
                to Dinner. At dinner met
                two English gents—had quite a
                conversation. After dinner, we
                got a friend or guide, started out
                in search of Curiosities.—            
               
            </p>
             
            
            
            
            <p>
                First we went to the Church
                S<sup>t</sup> <span class="sic">Sira[sic]</span>.
               On our entrance, a
                perfect blaze of paintings flashed before us. It seemed thronged
                with masses of the pencil's populace. Angels and Saints in
                white shone around. Saint
                Peter from the end, &amp; the other
                Apostles from the side niches
                attracted our Eye. Forty marble
                columns there were &amp; several
                domes. We afterwards went to
                other churches, which exhibited
                the same general brilliant array
                of fresco &amp; oil painting. Marble
                columns, twisted, fluted &amp;
                colored, caught the Eye. One
                church however was entirely
                white.
               <a name="pMaria" class="notePointer"></a><a href="#nMaria" class="annotation" title="The Church of Santa Maria (A Buckeye Abroad 100)."><sup class="noteAnchor">39</sup></a> All the others betrayed
                a mixture of Gothic &amp; <span class="sic">Sarcenic[sic]</span>,
                of the  [?]  in fact.—We 
                went to the Ducal palace, entered
               
                
               
                
               
                the great council chamber, saw the
                casts put in by Bonaparte when the
                feast was given. The  [original?]  casts
                were destroyed by the French in 
               1797.
                In all the paintings I saw can
                remember but few, — the Circumcision by Rubens; the Christ &amp; the
                Jews with Money, the Tasso; some
                Vandykes, these latter of the Salle
                gallery. We visited two of the 
                principal palaces; saw the great
                splendid roofs &amp; rooms, the
                vault of one as well as the
                room, of gold⁓It was a rare
                gleam of splendor. But the
                paintings. Oh! how I would love 
                to linger at Genoa. What a mind
                of Genius has been here amidst
                this blazonry of painting. How
                many throbs, wild &amp; great, has
                followed the million touches of
                the magic pencil. Here Rubens
               
                
               
                
               
                worked, and here the nobles of
                ancient Genoa themselves handled
                the pencil with true genius. How
                many scenes of Joy &amp; Sorrow, has
                this genius embodied; not of ideal
                only, but of real; for the Ideal
                in its last analysis is based on
                the imitation of the real. What
                lights &amp; shades, what forms of beauty
                and delight here shone lustrous upon the minds of the gifted.

            <p>
                During the morning while visiting churches &amp; palaces, we did not
                forget a splendid suburban palace
                with gardens attached—We were
                led to it from a public promenade,
                amid oranges. When we ascended,
                what did we see; busts, a palace,
                grottos, mirrors, library, orange
                groves, figs, urns with flowers of
                every kind. After strolling about, &amp;
                riding upon a 4 horse gymnasium,
               
                               
               
               
               
                we descended again to the City. 
                Our guide or laquais de place              
                seemed a little dull, but au fait               
                in painting. He talked so abominably much, that I did not like 
                to start him by making Enquiry.
                On my return with a bad headache, &amp; a repose of an hour, I finished a full description of all to 
               Col.
                M. Sent if off ⁓ Soon we were              
                ready again for our steamer; &amp;
                with Mrs. <span class="sic">Stevens[sic]</span>
               &amp; Co, we entered the               
                bateau &amp; were aboard at 5 P.M.                
                A large n<sup>o</sup> of Americans were at
                supper, &amp; politics were discussed
                considerably. Made Italy run 
                quite away. We sunk her for the
                Nonce. As Genoa glided away,                
                I stood upon the deck with my
                ever dear Companion (whom may 
                God bless!) and gazed into the
                compact city, wondering how so
                much wealth, Art, Genius and
               
                               
               
               
               
                Power could therein congregate,
                wondering most how from this
                town set among the hills, and
                circumscribed, Columbus
                could ever have sprung, whose
                grasp mastered the great
                hidden secret of ages, and
                revealed the reality of the dream
                of Grecian sages of a Western
                land of Beauty. But Genoa
                has died away from the sight, not
                from Memory. As the Sun sunk
                tonight in a pink &amp; golden sky,
                only to be resurrected on the morrow, so will the Memory of the
                palaces &amp; churches of the Superb
                City rise on the Morrow, and
                may that morrow be as Endless
                as the ages.

                I now sit writing, under the
                cabin window. The smooth tongue
                of the white robed monks above
                falls liquidly upon the ears. My

                Our touch at Genoa it seems to
                me, cannot be blotted out by
                even the Glories of the Eternal City,
                for have we not seen Beauty,
                and is she not more Eternal
                than the seven hills; &amp; does she
                always choose the place of
                Power? Tomorrow we touch at

            Leghorn,
             June 4 /51
            
            
            <p>
                Woke up to find ourselves at Leghorn; Philo went on shore
                with Miss Pratt, to whom he is
                growing o'er fond for his happiness;
                Julia waited for me — who having
                written till late to send a letter off
                at Leghorn to father, lay abed till
                7 AM. Well, arrived at Leghorn,
                we stopped with Mrs. Stephens. She
                has a peculiarly vigorous mind,
                full of prejudices, but grasping facts
                &amp; consequences so readily, as to
               
                
               
               
               
                remind me of D<sup>r</sup> Wayland.  She gave
                us a copy of her verses at Rome,
                On the occasion of the celebration
                of Washington's birth Day at 
               Rome
                last Winter.— Leghorn is a motley
                place. There is a statue of a Son
                of a Duke, supported by the figures
                of 4 by Algerine pirates. The
                story is that having sent abroad to
                conquer them, he returned so flushed
                with victory as to break the quarantine,
                the penalty of which is — Death. The
                Brutus of a Duke carried out
                the law — &amp; this monument was the
                atonement.

                In company with Lieut's. Nelson
                &amp; Rutledge U.S. Navy of the Steamship
                Mis — we visited the grave yard,
                where among many monuments of
                marble that of Tobias Smollett
                appears. I copied the inscription
                &amp; sketched the pyramid. Looked
               
                
               
               
               
                about the grassy yard, gathered
                flowers as mementos, then visited
                the Mississippi. The boat looked fine,
                the officers treated us finer. Met &amp;
                was introduced to Powers, 
               the Sculptor, on board. Who was sending his 
                son to West Point. Powers wore a 
                flabby sort of round topped hat;
                had a rotund pleasant face, and
                an intilligent big eye of brightness. 
                Mrs Stephens &amp; myself disagreed as 
                to our opinions of his "Greek
                Slave." We could not disagree as
                to his <em>bonhommie</em>

                While aboard the 
               Miss, the pennant of the Commodore appeared,
                &amp; we enjoyed the pleasure of seeing
                him (Morgan)  
               The officers had
                us sent ashore in his cutter;— 12
                sailors dipping time with their oars
                musically &amp; finely. The cutter danced
                over the waves somewhat better for
                us than the boat we went out in.
               
                
               
               
               
                Philo got a splash getting aboard.
                We saw a gun that fired 130 times
                at San Juan D'Ulloa in the 
                Mexican War. The Miss, it is
                said, is going to Constantinople to
                take Kossuth &amp; his companions aboard.

                After bidding <em>adieu</em> 
               (Which Philo
                did <em>painfully</em> no doubt) with our good
                company we went aboard Languedoc. We saw the Isle of Elba dim 
               in the 
               distance,— Our old Spanish Count, Marquess
                &amp; grandee, with a very ordinary look,
                kept us in conversation for some time,
                told us many stories — the one of
                the Prussian Crown Prince, himself
                &amp; the American ladies was a good
                one. Mrs. Stephens will get it in
                her book. He gave Mrs. S. letters
                to his noble friends, among whom
                were the Countess Berry, Mother of
                Henry 5. (French "Pretender".)

                Was sick — &amp; didn't eat supper
                went to bed to find fleas &amp; wake
                up at Civita Vecchia, where now
               
                               
               
               
               
                I write. The course of our Journey
                has been changed from Naples
                until we visit Rome.  The U.S.
                Consul arranged it right cleverly. We had some trouble here;
                but not much, considering —
                the <em>pauls</em> have to be paid; but 
                <em>Rome</em> is near! Glorious Rome!

                Civita Vecchia is a heavy
                massive looking place. The harbor
                is surrounded with walls. Old
                monks peep out  &amp; French soldiers
                with the red pants are on guard.
                A gun fired, &amp; the white Papal
                flag is raised from the fort.  
                Breakfast ate, we looked from
                the hotel piazza, to the port, or
                gate built by Trajan. Our hotel is
                the Orlandi. It is a good one. Put
                in our letter to father here: finished
                my journal, &amp; will soon be enroute
                for the Eternal City! Hurrah!

                At  Civita Vecchia: Here let me enter my
                verdict re. Italians. The higher classes
                are decent, polite &amp; refined. The lower
                classes are hard cases; They look hard,
                in dirty tatters, and with saucy deportment — <span class="sic">mishaven[sic]</span> and sallow— &amp; seemingly
                incapable of a noble thought. Good
                heaven! Can this be the degenerate
                scion of the old Roman tree! What a
                hard looking scoundrel was that one
                which Lieut. Nelson ordered to be bayonetted off the "Mississippi',

            Rome, Eternal Rome!
            Thursday June 5, 1851                
            
            
            <p>
               Here we are in the city of past
               secular Power, &amp; present Spiritual
               Power. Can it be possible? Will 
               our friends at home believe it. Have 
               we trod where <span class="sic">Caesor[sic]</span>, 
               &amp; Pompey and 
               the whole host of Romans trod? 
               Good God! Can these old  [?]  &amp; 
                [?] , high walls be the scenes of 
               Pomp &amp; Power? What thronging 
               Emotions cluster here. This is the 
               
                               
               
                
               
                theatre of glory, which years ago I
                read of as a myth, a glorious fable,
                this is the foster child of the foster 
                children of the she wolf. This is the
                scene of the Gracchis, 
               of Tully, of Sallust
                of Old Horace, ha ha! of jolly old
                Horace,⁓ Here Augustus ruled so
                goldenly and Juvenal satired
                so bitingly! Here Cato gave the 
                world an example for age, and
                Quintillian canons of criticism
                as eternal as Truth. Can it be that  
                yon old round crumbling circle 
                of walled massiveness is the Colesseum, wherein thousands sent up
                to the welkin their shouts of Joy 
                over the cruelties of the ring! Can 
                that be the Tiber, with its statued 
                bridge, so grim &amp; fine under the 
                moonlight, while the yellow waters
                slowly move below? And is it 
                indeed S<sup>t</sup> Peters whose Pantheon 
               
                               
               
               
               
                hung in air, we have seen for the
                last four hours. For as we approached this Eternal city S<sup>t</sup> Peters dome 
                hung near us, seemingly within
                a mile or so, until we passed  
                through the Aurelian way, &amp; apast
                vineyards high walled, and entered
                the Porta <span class="sic">Cavallleggieri[sic]</span> (where
                the French fought 1849,) — when
                lo! immediately before us rose S<sup>t</sup>. 
                Peter's!! We passed by it, looking 
                out upon it, before we passed
                within the gate. It did not seem 
                so high at first; but it did <em>seem</em>
                huge. We traversed the piazza
                S<sup>t</sup> Peters, and did not recognize
                the Castle of St Angelo; but took
                it for the Colliseum. I see by the
                guide book, it must have been 
                a mistake. After a good supper, 
                (Lucy &amp; Philo being tired, not being good 
                at land travelling) Julia &amp; I partook heartily &amp; retired at leisure, to get
               up on

            <p>
               Tired enough last night: but 
               began our work with visiting 
               the Borghese &amp; 
               Albani villas.
               The former — is in ruins partly —
               fine park — good Sculpture, elegant paintings. The latter has
                some old gems, a Praxiteles

                finely to the Constantine Basilica—the ruins of the Sacra

            Sunday June 8. 1851.
            
            
            <p>
                At 9, we left after writing
                for Santa <span class="sic">Cistene[sic]</span> chapel
                in S<sup>t</sup> Peters, where the Pope
                ministered; We arrived in
                time, our ladies in veils —
                we in borrowed black coats.
                I pushed through the buff
                Swiss guard, into the aisle
                with monks &amp; soldiers, where
                I watched the red Cardinals
                &amp; their purple <span class="sic">Servents[sic]</span> enter,
               
                               
               
               
               
                bow, and nestle like peacocks,
                then sit down in matchless
                dignity. At last in rushed some
                Swiss Knights with drawn swords:
                the quoir struck up; &amp; a fine
                looking, well meaning, full faced
                man, in a gold cloth dress &amp;
                tiara, entered, &amp; around him 
                rushed &amp; kneeled "all sorts"—,
                of clergy — It was Pope Pio 
                <em>nono</em>. The ceremony of taking 
                the seat over, the kissing of
                the hands of the Pope by the
                Cardinals, an Abyssinian 
                was put up to preach,
                which he did in Latin. I
                rec'd a copy of the sermon. Absolution being given; we entered S<sup>t</sup>.  
                Peters; looked around its majestic departments. The statues
                of Popes, the paintings of masters,
                and the sacred things, alternately attract our attention. The holy 
                awe of Notre Dame is not
                here. There is too much tinsel. The
                church has too much form,
                not so much of the Infinite.
                The large arch under the dome
                which swims as you look at
                it is fine, but gaudy. We stopped awhile to look down
                the piazza — the fountains played — Paul &amp; Peter guarded their
                charge; &amp; the lofty <span class="sic">Columnade[sic]</span>
                glittered in the noon sun.

            <p>
                Visited in a carriage the underground &amp; extensive ruins of Nero. We saw by
                the lighted candles the paintings on 
                the wall. Here the <span class="sic"> [Laoocoon?] [sic]</span> 
                was Murray 321found. Then to the old temple
               
                                              
               
               
               
                of Bacchus, now a church, Round — 
                The martyrs were about the
                walls in all their agonies —
                Then to S<sup>t</sup> John Lateran (Muray 497-399) Saw the Antinous
                heard the chaunt, lighted Candles,
                saw table of last Supper; hole
                thro' which a wafer fell; Constantines vase, in which he was
                baptised: &amp; came out to
                laugh at a man &amp; a boy &amp; 
                a load of hay trotting over
                4 legs of a donkey. —
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Went to Santa <span class="sic">Cruce[sic]</span>, where
                the real cross <em>is</em>! (405) Saw
                temples of Venus and Cupid; &amp; the
                great gate, with the aqueducts  
                three. — Saw Minerva Medici,
                a large pile of ruins; then the

                visited the Capitol — marked
                the objects in Murray — The great

                [bronze?]  horse, Canovas gallery — purchased a painting
                S<sup>t</sup> Cecilia — Old inscriptions —
                &amp; then to the Tarpeian
                rock — terraces on it — houses
                under with crockery roofs —
                The Tiber distant 300 yards,
                fig trees growing around. —

                From that point we
                came amidst dirty streets,
                clothes hanging out &amp; children after us begging home
                to our hotel where we dine
                at 4 P.M. — All are now 
                asleep, but my dear wife.

             Tuesday June 10. 1851.

                Visited Caesar's palaces — Caracalla's baths, then to the tomb
                of Egeria, thence to the tomb 
                of Metella (read Byron to
                it.) thence to the temple of
                Vesta — Saw the Tiber &amp; strange              
                nets. Came home apast cobblers &amp; lazy rascals to dinner.
                must not forget temple of Bacchus,
                &amp; Circus Maxentius; nor Romulus temple. — Visited 
               the graves
                of <em>Shelley</em> &amp; <em>Keats</em>; procured
                flowers —"forever beauties." — )
                saw St Paul's &amp; <span class="sic">alabastar[sic]</span> pillars — St Sebastian &amp; catacombs; the pyramid of Caius
                Sextius—: Wrote to Father
                somewhat. Went after night
                by moonlight, &amp; saw the Colliseum. Wrote to father an account of it. Also other ruins,
                including fountain of <span class="sic">Treva[sic]</span>.

                Of today's work, can only
                refer to my letter to father &amp;
                to Murray; as well as to Julia's
                fine journal.  She is now in
                long hair writing away at it.
                She must quit soon &amp; sleep.
                So must I.  It has been an
                Eventful Day; &amp;  what a 
                crown for it is the Coliseum
                by moonlight! It must
                live ever in the Memory,
                with its lights and shades; &amp;
                its huge round towering
                up in the sky.

            Wednesday June 11. 1851.
            
            
            
            <p>
                Julia has posted up a fine journ
               al of to day, &amp; I must refer to it.
                As I make up letters about to days
                walk, I can only indicate the
                places by name. We passed to the
               Janiculum, the Repub. prison;
                &amp; the old Roman region.  Saw
                a scare crow of an old Roman,
                reminded me of Ichabod Crane.
                drove up amid fine walks to 
                Janiculum hill.  It overlooks
                finely the city, especiallyColiseum,
                Campagna &amp; Tusculan hills.
                A mist hangs over the hills. A 
                cloud fills up the hills between
               Tusculan &amp; Tivoli. Gardens of 
                grapes below.  French sparring
                with swords, &amp; horsemen practicing,
                some horses loose.  Went to the 
                fountain of S<sup>t</sup> Paul.  Saw palace
                of Garibaldi; things torn here, walls
                battered; places of balls plenty,
                Scene of conflict — Driver a Repub
               lican &amp; was with Garibaldi. I
               
                               
               
               
               
                got a stone from the grave of the 
                fallen Republicans, who were 
                buried without rites.  Two X X are 
                over the grave.  Drove next to <span class="sic">Corsina[sic]</span>
                palace. (p 508 Murray) noted
                what was worthy.  Julia noted
                &amp; wrote — soon passed it.  Stefano
                our guide, showed us a "natural
                panorama," in the market
                place, with  [founts?]  &amp;c. We next
                went to S<sup>t</sup> Augustine.  Saw such 
                idolatry (see Julia's journal)
                as made the heart sick.  Fine
                looking &amp; even intelligent people
                kissing the Virgin's Silver toe!!!
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Next to the Pantheon;
                "pride of Rome!" It exceeded my 
                idea of proportionale severe,
                perfect architecture.  A large
                aperture at top, niches for Gods,
                &amp; all, looks so fine.  The air swims
                apast the aperture as the cloud
                moves; &amp; it seems as if the pile
               
                               
               
               
               
                would fall.  What perfect symmetry.
                What methods! Its perfection has
                been its preservation; for like Virgil's
                epic, it has been universally approved &amp; used by Pagan &amp; Christian.
                The Vestal there, one of the Old 
                Statues, is now a Saint, decked 
                in jewels. Raphael lies there.
                We saw his tomb. Mass was being
                said before the shrine.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Next to the Colonna Palace
                saw the Last Judgement in ivory
                (see Julia) work of 30 years. Fine 
                heads of Artists — Splendid room,
                Cannon ball struck it.  We passed 
                out of it regretfully, apast the 
                baths of Constantine used as Stables
                up — up — admist oranges &amp; lemon
                to the old temple of the Sun; got 
                a piece of it &amp; a Scolding from
                Custodian. It presented a fine
                view from the sun's rock.
               
            </p>
            
                            
            
            
            
            <p>
                Next visited Rospigliosi palace.
                Guido's 
               morning — "Aurora" on
                the wall fresco — Copies (515 of 
                Murray) not much else. Then 
                came home to dine. ⁓
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After dinner, drove to the
                splendid little gem of the Torlioni Villa. Saw ruins aplenty
                of Rev. of 1848; but the sweetest
                house. The painter's &amp; bed room
                took me.. Could not — but Julia
                can describe it. Left it reluctantly. It was so chaste &amp; untinselled. Past the Popolo gate
                home, then after paintings; then 
                to the fine Pincian promenade,
                overlooking the city.  Then to
                the theatre.  Wasn't it funny to
                hear the Sweet Italian &amp; under an open sky, playing comedy. The scene was doubly comical. An old fop in the music
                piece took my Eye.  Came home
               
                               
               
               
               
                found our Consul had been here. — 
                ate a good Supper — finished my 
                letter to father 
                  
               — <span class="sic">hearkened[sic]</span> to the
                strange noises out in the city —
                looked at my good wife posting up
                her beautiful Journal in which She
                takes commendable pride  Why — because her 
               husband does — closed               
                mine — for the night. ⁓
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The only useful principle learned 
                to day, is the old one, that riches
                &amp; taste may not be Safe even in
                this Strong government of Popery.
                We have seen evidences of it to 
                day. But <em>Art</em> — Oh! how is it
                worshipped here. Daily bread
                hangs on the beautiful. <span class="sic">Maccaroni[sic]</span> depends on graceful limning or chaste mosaic. Every
                one is emulous of being admirers  
                of the fair. The Idolatry of the
                Virgin is no fiction — that I
                have learned too. But Education
                thou art strong; &amp; we should be
                liberal.

            Thursday June 12 1851.
            
                            
            
            <p>
                This is the Vatican day. Went early
                to  S<sup>t</sup>. Peter's — found it dimly dark, but
                lighted with candles under the dome. Long
                red drapery hung down, and the immense
                pile looked splendid yet awful! The 
                first Sight, which lacked that vacancy
                &amp; awe inspiring influence evanished;
                and the  [?]  home of the Eternal
                One swelled up &amp; swam before the
                reeling Eye. The monks were chanting it seemed a great distance <span class="sic">of[sic]</span>;
                yet it was only in a side chapel.
                We descended beneath into the
                old floor of S<sup>t</sup> Peter's — Saw the
                tombs of the Popes — &amp; fine frescoes.
                Then after tugging and resting &amp; gazing out of windows we reached
                the top of the dome. I led the 
                way — &amp; ascended by an iron ladder
                into the ball. It is 9 ft diameter, looks
                2 below. It was hot enough at 8 A.M.
                Didn't stay long; the sense of being 
                so high, worse than the sight, made
                me <span class="sic">feely[sic]</span> dizzy and qualmy!. I
                then put Julia up.  She didn't mind
                it.  Not her.  We descended, &amp; then
               
                  
               
               
               
                for the Vatican — its immense courts 
                &amp; rooms only (11000.) threaded the
                room of inscriptions, statuary &amp;
                <span class="sic">frescos[sic]</span> &amp; paintings. Raphael's transfiguration we saw &amp; looked at
                long. It was being copied by 3
                artists. Others were by Raphael there
                the <span class="sic">frescos[sic]</span> surpassed Everything. See
                Murray. We then went into
                the different departments &amp; porticos
                of statuary. Saw <span class="sic"><em>Laoccoon</em>[sic]</span>.
                in its terrible glory of Ppower &amp;
                convulsion — the <span class="sic"><em>Appollo Belvi</em><em>dere</em>[sic]</span>, the light &amp; beautious God
                of Day &amp; Poesy. Never was I so 
                struck with human form, as when we
                entered that part. The Laocoon
                needs study, the <span class="sic">Appollo[sic]</span> is a beautiful Dignity at the first Sight.  The
                hall of busts &amp; of animals (!) &amp; the
                hall of inscriptions were examined,
                then tapestry rooms; &amp; amid a maze
                of wonder, we entered the receptable 
                of the literature of nearly every
               
                  
               
               
               
                language. What a beauteous
                Library — was disappointed
                in not seeing some old Mss. Saw
                a diploma from a pope in year 
                500 &amp; something. Admired again
                the 360 columns &amp; the great
                piazza with its figures and
                fountains, &amp; came home to
                go out shopping; buy mosaics
                &amp; Look at pictures. Forgot
                to say that we entered the
                mosaic factory &amp; saw them at
                work, making the Saints &amp; popes
                by the hundred for S<sup>t</sup>. Paul's. —

            <p>
                Tired enough to Day.  We
                took our lunch in the Vatican; head of butter [lettuce] , lemonade
                &amp; sponge cake. But hadn't 
                we a time to Day. Ought to
                have a week to finish it.
                Going again to day. —

            Friday June 13. 1851.  
            
            
            
            <p>  Had an uninteresting and unprofitable ride rather to Mt.
                Mario, at the North Side of Rome.
                Then came down — visited the
                Borghese palace, then adjourned
                to the Vatican, where we entered the
                Sistine Chapel — Saw the great
                paintings there, including
                Angelo's last Judgement — Saw
                the Cardinal in hell, with his
                ass' ears. Then Julia must
                jump up &amp; pop into the Papal
                Chair in which we saw Pope
                Pius on Sunday.  The Custodian
                if he had seen her, might have
                had the Swiss guards called &amp; the
                partner of my bosom dragged to
                a mel—an—choly fate in
                the gloomy dungeons of the Inquisition which we saw from
                the top of S<sup>t</sup> Peters, or the horrid
                old Castle of S<sup>t</sup> Angelo.
               
                           
               
               
               
                Passed thro' the Egyptian museum,
                Saw mummies, gods <span class="sic">Sarcopahi[sic]</span>, &amp; crocodiles — then into the 
                Etruscan galleries — rare old
                collection of Vases, &amp; culinary
                apparatus. Strolled lazily
                down the walk out of the Vatican
                admiring the great Tapestry, (one
                representing Solomon judging
                between the women struck me)
                which they are fixing up for
                the approaching fête. — Swiss
                Guards in fancy uniforms abounded.  Got a carriage
                &amp; came home to write, having 
                nearly finished Rome. The
                sound of martial music
                breaks in the Ear. How different
                is all — from the placid Vale
                of our native Muskingum.
                Yet this is not our home.
                We think of going to Jerusalem — M<sup>r</sup> Berry of Boston
               
                put the idea into our head.
                Nous verrons at Naples.

                Have not done much today but write
                letters &amp; take it easy. Bought another picture 'Madeline', bought by
                Stefano.  Wanted to buy some more.
                but couldn't — ordered one which
                M<sup>r</sup> Cass promised to have sent.
                Called on him; Saw the famous 
                Bibles which he had presented him
                by priests; looked at the landscapes — Wrote to Medary, ordered
                our pictures to be sent home —: closed
                the Evening with Rev M<sup>r</sup> Barry of
                Boston, talking of the Holy Land,
                which we have concluded
                to visit <em>sure</em>. Now good
                night, Julia is hurrying me,
                and I say, goodnight.

                On Campagna, by

                all beautifully shine as
                we move apast the dark sides
                of the hills. We are now stopped
                half way to feed. The moon
                glistens on the sea as it
                breaks over the ruins, splashes
                in beauty in its light.
                A rarer night never was
                spread out to the moon.
                Rough looking fellows are
                about. An Italian Song is 
                sung. The ladies have promenaded to the sea to
                enjoy the exquisite spectacle. It

                Arrived at 6; stopped to rub eyes, pick
                flowers &amp; chat about Garibaldi with
                the Driver. All these Italians who are
                not ' [Messeling?] ' are great lovers of Garibaldi
                They want to know if he is in America.
                How finely old Rome looked as we 
                passed through it last eve, "at set of 
                sun. the bridge &amp; Castle of San Angelo
                towered up round against the mellow
                twlight sky. S<sup>t</sup> Peters looked dark &amp;
                its colonnades gloomy; but how finely
                did the twin sheafs of water bend
                over with the rich harvesting of spray,
                light &amp; fleecy. Rome looked finer on 
                leaving than when we first saw her.

            Naples Bay, Tuesday 
            morn'g at
             6 A.M, June 17, 1851. —
            
            
            
            <p>
                We woke up in the prettiest bay
                so called in the world; not the bay
                itself but in our boat. The band at
                the fort are bursting their brazen instruments, clanking &amp; clanging. The
                noise of unintelligible jargon surrounds
                us. Naples lies around as if at right
                angles, church domes appear; &amp; upon
                a lofty hill trellised with vines &amp; 
                adorned finely is a large church. The
                red shot tower looking concern near
                the musicians is a tower. Soldiers are
                posted about — white dressed. There does
                not seem to be much in Naples. We
                can't get off till 8. Have been fixing
                up matters for the custom house. —
                Vesuvius may be seen and known by
                the white little streamer from its
                broken, crater like summit. It
                appears where it is represented, yet
                not nine miles off. It has a
                brother mountain near by. —

            <p>
               
                At 12, lunched ashore, &amp; started for
                Vesuvius at 1.; We stopped to
                see the Herculaneum ruins. Saw
                the theatre &amp; some houses; looked
                in a good state of preservation.
                Went up the mountains amid
                such a <span class="sic">Paradize[sic]</span> of fruits &amp;
                flowers — stopped at the Hermitage
                &amp; lunched; then took horses; &amp;
                higher up we went amid iron
                rocks; following our guides—an
                <span class="sic">exhilerating[sic]</span> company. This
                was the <em>real</em> fun. What a
                company we had; under the
                lead of Antonio; 
               At the base of
                the crater part, we took  [it?] 
                foot,ladies in chairs; ¾ of
                an hour we tugged up. An old
                fellow with the basket was
                my guide. A strap over his
                shoulder helped me along. I
                was first atop. Saw the yellow
               
               
               
                  
               
                grim smoky crater. Went further
                along over smoky ground &amp;
                ashes, trembling &amp; half suffocated; until we stood upon
                the brink of—hell; rolled
                some stones down at the Devil,
                heard him growl below—way
                way—<em>way</em> down—Miles; came
                up the Sound, hollow &amp; awful—
                while the smoke curled about
                &amp; the sulphur filled the air.
                The gorges on either side were
                awful; but this crater was 
                the perfection &amp; sublimity of
                horror! We went over the great
                crater bed from which Pompeii  
                was filled. Saw the guides
                light the torches, &amp; with their
                light we took our way down,
                with great ease. The Sun went
                down, just as I reached the
                top. It looked fine. The isles
               
                  
               
               
                &amp; bay swam in a splendor
                unlike any I ever saw. — The 
                coaxing, hullabaloo of the
                guides for money, <q>"They were 
                   so <em>fateeged</em>,"</q> the rascals.
                Such a pack of devils only
                ought to herd about the confines of this infernal hole.
                They are the appropriate genii
                of the spot. We came down in
                fine style. The ladies were 
                not afraid, tho' even in going
                up. It was a funny scene,
                that of going down by torches
                while Naples danced below
                in her ball costume all glittering with jewels; rather like the
                bride of the Mediterranean
                <span class="sic">alseep[sic]</span> &amp; <span class="sic">recumbant[sic]</span>, while
                her forehead was gleaming with

                so refreshed.

                Started early at 12 for Pompeii—
                lunched outside the city, took up
                our line of march thro' street &amp;
                theatre, baker shop &amp; tomb. Saw
                the most revolting evidences of
                degeneracy &amp; vice. Wonderful
                paintings &amp; singular domestic
                arrangements. A history such
                as has never been written. 
                Pompeii lies beyond the Volcano,
                &amp; was flooded from that side.
                Its theatres were great. A queer
                comic genius sang for us in
                the Comic theatre. At sun
                set we were upon the towers
                of the amphitheatre. Oh! the 
                view around was fine. Julia will
                mete it—&amp; I for print—Came
               
                               
               
               
                home under altars &amp; illuminations. Tomorrow is fête day,
                <em>Corpus Domini</em> day. Such a
                display. All out doors at it.
                Fountains fine &amp; streets magically beauteous. Julia &amp; I
                walked amidst them.

            <p>
                Stayed at home all morn,
                others went to see churches &amp;
                fête. Saw—they did—a queer
                fig tree in a Sacristy, growing
                out of an oak. Afternoon we
                went to see Virgils tomb, rode
                amidst splendid scenery, saw
                the isles and bay from different
                points, saw fine little romantic
                spots on bay; drove up &amp; down
                <span class="sic">amdst[sic]</span> the beauty and wealth
                of Naples, far excelling any 
                thing yet seen of the Kind.—then
                came home for the Opera.
               
            </p>
            
                            
            
            
            
            <p>
                Visited the Opera. It was at the
                San Carlo theatre — the largest in the
                world. It was finely decorated &amp; arranged,
                the kingly crown of Naples standing over
                one of the boxes. The opera was that of
                Maria de <span class="sic">Rudentz[sic]</span>, well executed
                especially the part of Maria, who was
                killed three times &amp; still survived.
                The ballet, a pretty piece came next.
                The sailor's star shot down on the
                stage &amp; was the gracefullest little
                being I ever saw move on the stage.
                The opera was by Donizetti. The
                scene was unusual. The reproachful
                music of the loving yet betrayed
                Maria, was touching to sadness.—

                Visited the Museum, saw the wonders of Pompeii &amp; Herculaneum — 
                remarkable statues &amp; pictures;
                a picture <em> [modern?] </em> of the 4 ages was
                fine. The Farnese Bull &amp; Hercules
               
               
               
               
               
                attracted the Eye as celebrities.
                Fine stones &amp; vases too were
                to be seen. Tired we came
                home to dine. &amp; take a drive to
                 thro' the city.

                put the dead after 18 m<sup>os</sup> in
                the houses of the ground — built
                monuments in a fine ground,
                beautifully laid off. We
                were accompanied by our
                guide Antonio, &amp; by M<sup>r</sup> &amp;
                Mrs. French of Boston. Returned
                home to look at Cathedral.
                Saw 40 big silver images of
                Saints; as well as Silver vessels
                in abundance in Cathedral
                Have to pay for it. This church

                Spent Sunday morn, in looking at
                the bay &amp; writing. Afternoon after
                dinner, saw the great procession
                of Saint Louis, extending for miles
                with music, banners &amp; the Elevation

                Firing incessant followed at either

                were — the crowds were dense &amp;immense,
                all well dressed &amp; neat. The Naples folk
                are the best dressed people in the world —

            Tuesday morng, June 24. 1851.
            
            
            <p>
                We are now lying at the head of Sicily in
                <span class="sic">Massena[sic]</span> harbor, having arrived here
                at 8 AM. We left Naples at 1, &amp; was
                long in losing sight of her beautiful bay. All
                went below to sleep, while I alone stayed
                upon deck to see Capri. We passed between
                Capri &amp; the Point Campanelli; leaving Sorrento
                &amp; Castel a Mare behind, &amp; Vesuvius hid from
                our view forever. The isle looked bleak and
                rocky near by, as it did in the distance.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On the seaward side, I saw the arch in
                the sea through which the waves of light
                &amp; water rolled. The Appenines range close
                to the shore: high pallisades rising 3000 ft
                or more perpendicularly from the sea, guarded
                the coast. The rocks were covered with a
                sort of yellow lichen; now &amp; then were
                spots of cultivation. We gradually diverged
                from shore, leaving the gulf of Salerno
                behind us, until we reached <span class="sic">Port[sic]</span> Palinurus; where (near abouts) we watched the
                sun round &amp; golden roll down his disk
                into the waves. The waves were lit into
                blazing beauty by his fire; a long line of
                flashing gold, gradually dying into the
                richest purple. The spray near our 
                boat was royal in its color as the robes
                of the Caesar. A canopy of cloud impurpled &amp; red, with spots of black hung
                over the declining orb; points of the cloud
                hanging down &amp; almost dripping with the
               
               
               
               
               
                sea. Soon the last tinge of gold died
                away: &amp; the rich  [interpurpling?]  of demi-twilight began.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We are aboard the French War steamer
                Sesostris, for Malta. A few passengers
                speak English. The accommodations are
                good. This morn I awoke up &amp; hurried
                on deck to see M<sup>t</sup> Etna, whose snowy top
                was just observable above the highlands
                of the N.E. part of Sicily. We had passed
                the gulfs which form the <em>instep</em> of the boot
                of the Italian peninsula in the night, &amp;
                were now in the gulf of Gioja, approaching
                <span class="sic">Cape di Fara[sic]</span> — the veritable Scylla, 12
                miles from <span class="sic">Massena[sic]</span>. Where the dogs of
                Homer barked in the cavernous wave
                washed rocks, we saw but slight ripples.
                The tide was not such as to make it
                dangerous. The waves glistened blue &amp; bright,
                Oh! how clearly, transparently blue! The
                sailors had just washed the decks &amp; were
                busy washing &amp; burnishing the metalic
                portions of the deck: The whistle of the
                boatswain &amp; the bustle of the , the
                cries of the officers to the pilot announces
                that some precaution is still necessary
                even with steam, at this point of classic
                terror. Our boat moves on; but no opening
                appears for it. All is rock bound, save
                a sand bar &amp; a fret. Soon we discern
                Messina, pass the <span class="sic">whirpool[sic]</span> Charybdis
                no great things, (not equal to Hell gate)
                &amp; land in <span class="sic">Massena[sic]</span>. The head point of
               
               
               
               
               
                Sicily is a windowless deserted fishing town;
                but <span class="sic">Massena[sic]</span> is quite a pretty place, half
                hid under the rough, uneven mountains,
                orange covered, yet bleak looking
                which overtop &amp; surround it. Almonds,
                lemons, &amp; other rich fruits grow upon
                them.  We pass under the guns of the
                fort; are soon sorrounded with boats.
                Such a jabber as they &amp; the hands on deck
                make. French, you see! At breakfast
                we were deserted by green almonds, yellow
                
               apricots, cherries, ripe pears. 
               Philo
                bought some ripe figs just pulled, They
                looked &amp; tasted like our pawpaws — a
                sickly sweet taste.  We <em>feel</em> ourself in
                the South! The scenery grows more 
                Southern. This isle of Sicily — what vicissitudes has she not had? Her
                earlier history is wrapped in fables &amp;
                myths. She was the land of giants,
                who strode over her <em>shaking</em> isle;
                of Cyclopean workers, who had their
                forge in Ætna. Homer &amp; 
               Virgil both people her with these creations of the brain
                Her first inhabitants were from Spain.
                It was successively held by Saraceus,
                Turks, Spaniards, 
               French, Austrians.  The 
                Bourbon house was replaced upon the
                throne in 1820 I think; &amp; after the
               
                Revolution of 1848, which for a time
                separated Sicily from Naples, had
                proved unsuccesful, she was again
               
               
               
               
               
                reduced under the control of Ferdinand
                II: the brutal despot of Naples.  
               We have
                not been ashore. As I write we are
                moving away from <span class="sic">Massena[sic]</span>.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After breakfast, we went on deck,
                when looking astern, I discovered
                our boat <em>afire</em>! The sail was
                blazing. I did not know what to
                halloo, — so I told  our 
               English
                friend &amp; he sung, <em>feu</em>! The sailors
                leaped into the rigging, tore the sails, &amp;
                with the aid of water, Lucy's fears
                (Julia had none) were removed.
                How fine is the air &amp; the sky here!
                And the isle is it not called by Homer
                truly, the "isle of the Sun."—
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Our banker at Naples is bright. He 
                paid us $160. too much in gold. The
                banking house is away up in a
                steeple of a Church, not so high as
                Vesuvius. The Italians are totally unfit for business. Fond of pleasure, &amp;
                irresponsible even for their souls, they
                commit them to the priests, &amp; live to
                enjoy, while the little day of their
                life lasts.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The scenery here is one magical combination of light &amp; shade, mellowed &amp;
                softened. The thin lustral mist which
                dims the distant mountains mellows the
               
                              
               
               
               
                landscape, altho' the line of the shore is
                broken into jagged points &amp; uneven at
                every part. Every where  is the magic
                of Beauty. Scylla &amp; 
               Charybdis lose all
                their terror to us, who have weathered
                the vexed Atlantic. In such a clime
                even the volcanoes are robbed of all
                terror.

                How apparent throughout Italy is the 
                difference between the old &amp; new civilization; the old, absorbed the individual in
                the state; the new has released the individual. Domestic comfort (as may be seen
                in Pompeii) was not known then as
                now. Home was the country not the 
                house. Even yet this appears in
               Italy.

                Naples is hopelessly enslaved
                politically. The King has such forts &amp;
                arms as to preclude all resistance.
                Another <span class="sic">Mansaniella[sic]</span> may arise

                assert the supremacy of the people;
                but Austria is ever ready to help
                her Bourbons to power; &amp; the hope
                is dead for Liberty. The government
                encourages pleasure &amp; priestly rule;
                &amp; renders the mind of the people oblivious of all inherent rights.

                We are sliding off the toe of her 
                boot into other lands. Today we
                pass where Paul did en route
                to Rome, saw Syracuse where he stopped I believe to get a compass.  It is
                a pretty place on a barren sort of place,
                The sun was going down as we passed
                it, &amp; colored each place with its light.

               Cape Murro di 
                Porco is a square sort of rocky
                ledge; — Before leaving its <span class="sic">waved[sic]</span>
                lashed point, we took a a farewell of 
                M<sup>t</sup> Etna which looked dimly distant,
                surrounded by its haze &amp; overhead
                by a cohort of clouds. The mt. is
                10,000 feet high. It looks much
                higher from this side; because there
                are no mountains to intercept the
                view. Shakespeare has given to
                Syracuse some local habitations
                for his Muse; &amp; Mathematicians
                hail it as the residence for some
                years of Archimedes. Each step of
                our forward way, brings us into the
                region of Intellectual Supremacy,
                exercised by the Eye of the world,
                Athens. We rocked considerably

            <em>Malta</em>, June 25/1851.
            
            
            
            <p>
                where upon going to the Mediterranean
                house we broke our fast — visited
                M<sup>r</sup> Winthrop, our Consul; got instructions as to our progress; visited
                S<sup>t</sup> John's Cathedral, saw the tombs of
                the "Knights of Malta." — returned home
                to write. Wrote a letter to Col. M. &amp; left it
                with our Consul.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The tombs of the monkish soldiers are
                very curious. We visited the crypt below
                the Cathedral. The Church was covered 
                with green orange leaves, as yesterday
                was the festal day of S<sup>t</sup> John. This isle
                was given to the Order, after they were
                driven out of Palestine, by 
               <em>Char V</em>. The
                Grand Masters since the 15<sup>th</sup> century,
                have ruled here, building palaces &amp; public works. Six different languages were
                here represented.  A fine picture of S<sup>t</sup>
                John by Carravagio is in the Church.
                The tapestries likewise, are splendid
                and rare.
               
            </p>
            <p>
                We also visited the Armory, which has
                17,000 stand of British arms, — Above are
                ranged the armors of the Knightly retainers,
                &amp; at either end are the full length armors
                of some of the Grand Masters curiously
                inlaid with gold. Different arms are about,
               
                              
               
               
                which represent the warlike instruments
                of the earlier eras; Turkish arms taken
                by the Knights are here also. Walter Scott       
                would like to have been here.

                The streets of Malta glistened with a
                painful dazzle. The houses are of white
                stone. Cleanliness is apparent. But such
                a pest of beggary never beset humanity,
                as beset us, when we sallied out of our
                Hotel to the steamer. I carried a club,
                &amp; had to beat them off almost.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We entered the sides of the French War
                steamer Egyptus for Athens. Just before
                we left, Music was heard below in
                a boat, 4 fellows smoking &amp; fiddling.
                Not a cent did they get. On the[y]  sawed;
                &amp; on they rowed. Our mate began giving
                orders to get under way. Still they
                fiddled--"Abord!" tutytuty twang!
                "Sacre  [?] !" Soon were were under 
                way, passing between the 8 fortifications
                which the Knights built to make
                Malta, the strongest place in the world.
                The involutions of stone walls, over
                which red coats are peeping, seems
                impregnable. Soon we pass in the
                open sea, which tosses high &amp; rough.
                Eight or ten ships, lay like long shadows
                in the distant offing, spectral &amp; dim.
                It was the English fleet, returning to 
                Malta.  <span class="sic">Plenaria Indulgenzia[sic]</span>

                been reading all day, Murray's Greece:
                My heart throbs as I approach the
                scenes of Grecian story and glory. Athens
                Parnassus, Olympus, Marathon,
                Rhodes, Scio &amp; all the "blest isles"
                of the earliest civilization. Here upon
                these waves too, were once the terrific
                struggles of the Turk &amp; Venetian; the
                Greek &amp; Moslem. Here the combined
                fleets sunk the mighty flotilla of
                Ibrahim Pacha. Our course is
                still on —. It will be Saturday, ere we
                see the Pireus: Until then patience.

                We are now running between Cytheria
                &amp; the mainland of Greece. The dark
                clouds with long fringes hang over
                the ancient Sparta &amp; float far around
                to Cape Matapan, which we are fast
                leaving in the distance. The hills
                of Greece are dark and not ungracefully

            <p>
                To day, we arrived about 10 AM
                at the Pireus. Emotions better felt
                than told, welcomed our approach to
                the land of philosophy &amp; song.  We arrived safely however in the harbor, 
                having passed the isle of Salamis, when
                Themistocles covered himself all over
                with glory. The houses looked low, of 
                white stone and red roofed —
               
                                       
               
               
               
                presenting a singularly Oriental
                aspect. Soon the people appeared
                in crowds in boats about the gangway of our ships. Their costume is
                picturesque &amp; the attitude of some
                of them quite sculpturesque. Dressed in their long red caps with long
                blue tassels, a finely wrought vest
                over a white boddice, and a flowing
                skirt all around the body with leggings tasselled off in fine style — they
                formed a striking group. Most of 
                them were dressed differently, with wide
                dragging trousers. A great contest
                seemed to be going on as to who should
                get to our gangway first. All were huddled in, when plash! went the water
                from the wheel, &amp; away went the boats
                Several times was this repeated. At
                last two passengers ventured down, when
                a rough &amp; tumble fight <span class="sic">insued[sic]</span> for
                them. They rolled from boat to boat,
                barely missing the water, cuffing,
               
                                       
               
               
               
                kicking &amp; punching each other, until our
                officers ordered cold water to be thrown
                on them; &amp; a boat of a man of war
                came out to chase them off; which
                being done, we went ashore with an guide
               
                to the house of <em>M<sup>r</sup> Buell</em>, the very gentlemanly Baptist Missionary here. He lives
                in a fine house; his wife absent. Julia
                was taken sick here. Philo &amp; M<sup>r</sup>.
                Buell went to the Austrian Steamer
                Office to learn — that we cannot leave
                for Joppa until 10<sup>th</sup> July. Too late!
                for Jerusalem.—

            <p>
                Went with M<sup>r</sup> Buell to Athens 5 miles
                drive. Our driver wished to cheat us, &amp;
                we hired another — went to the temple
                of Theseus — in a perfect state of preservation; also to the Acropolis — mounted
                to the Bema — Examined where Demosthenes stood; Stood in his tracks, from
                which he "fulmined over Greece &amp; shook
                <span class="sic">Artaxererxes[sic]</span>' throne." It was a grand
                place to recall the scene of Demosthenes &amp; Eschylus. the limestone flint
                is of solid massiveness. The forum
                is cut out of it. Everything was finely
                arranged for severe Oratory. The place
                for the Gods was above; to which he
                could appeal, so solemnly. I know
                not which was most interesting — that
                spot or Mars Hill. We Could
                hear so distinctly the voices from
                the forum, altho' we were in the
                farthest part of the people's stand.              
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We next went to Mars <span class="sic">Hall[sic]</span>.
                It is a rough &amp; rugged ascent from
                the Bema. Though on the East its
                ascent is by steps. Some imagine
                Paul's auditory to have been on
                the steps; but no — it must have
                been on the top, just where I read
                his speech to the party. We next
                went to the top of the Acropolis,
                went thro' the Parthenon, observed its leaning peculiarly — &amp; that
                no line is entirely straight.
               
            </p>           
            
                                    
            
            
            
            
            <p>
                We went to the brow, looked at
                the temple of Jupiter Olympus, its
                columns (60 ft) still standing; Saw
                the stadium — the hills of Pentelicus,
                the plain — the place of the battle
                on the bay of Salamis; the olive
                groves on the part toward Sparta
                &amp; the West. Fine hills surround
                Athens — a very high rock rises
                on the other side. The City itself is
                not much. The King's palace fair, &amp;
                finely gardened. Schools  [rising?] ,
               
                markets full — queer costumes &amp;
                people; saw temple of the Winds, &amp;
                Winged Victory, The ruins are not
                plenty; but such as we saw are
                imposing. The Parthenon surpassing
                all;—in majesty of proportion &amp; size.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We returned so well satisfied; having seen so much in so short a time.
                The Olive groves of the Academy lay
                over to the West. Such a fine day as
                we had! Returned to take a delightful tea with M<sup>r</sup> Buell, whom
                we left with regret. He told us
                an incident about D<sup>r</sup> King &amp; the
                American flag, which pleased me,
                as well as his own incidents in
                the mob which drove him from
                Corfu; M<sup>r</sup> Buell accompanied
                us on board; &amp; we had quite a delightful time of it, altogether. Have
                determined to go to <span class="sic">Constaniople[sic]</span>, &amp;
                are aboard for that purpose. Have forgotten
                the lion couchant from Mr Buell's house
                cut in the hills of Sunium.

                Left the Pireus early; after breakfast passed Cape Sunium, saw
                the remains of the temple of Minerva on the beach or rocks. It
                looked white &amp; fine. Have been 
                dodging about in the <span class="sic">Archilpeligo[sic]</span>,
               
                passing rocky isles. Just passed
                Scio — Homers home — the Paradise
                of the Levant. Have finished a

                "<q>Milk in the name of Allah</q>!" (thus speaks
                the Orient;) is our first cry; We have
                just come on land, and have been <span class="sic">threadding[sic]</span> the streets of this city of figs &amp; one of
                the seven churches. We started for a hotel
                to get our breakfast; but couldn't get it
                before the heat of the day, so we sat under
                the canopy of a fine tent &amp; have called
                for breakfast. Our fat French friend
                has arrived &amp; with the "banker," are revelling in two big <span class="sic">chbouques[sic]</span>, getting up the
                steam, whilst the smoke bubbles

               (the

                old fellow shakes! On every side [space] are
                Turks in sweeping dignity moving about. Soldier fellows in red &amp; turbans.
                We saw two camels in the Streets.
               
            </p>
            
            
            
            
            
            
            <p>
                Two camels? Since writing the foregoing,
                if we have seen two, we have see over
                an hundred. We had to dodge them
                in the long, carriageless, donkeyful streets.
                These with the men form the principal
                beasts of burden. Men with long poles carry great loads of 200 lbs. Men with big
                platforms fastened to the back carry iron,
                bones &amp; everything portable. We got a Jew
                Abraham for a guide, in whose "<em>faith</em>" we were
                a little doubtful; he kept a string of Jews following &amp; dodging us at the corners. They grew as
                we progressed. My patience did not fail to
                suggest a last resort — after vain efforts before,
                in the shape of janissaries. It made the
                scoundrels drop our train quickly. "Good
                bye," sung out that blackeyed rascal of a
                Greek, in mockery of my own goodbye taunt.
                We went through bazaars after bazaars —
                great deep dark, ugly shops ranged under
                overarching sheds, in front of which on platforms sit red capped Armenians, and
                big turbaned Turks, in indolent dignity
                Jews are in their own quarters; the big
                nosed, hawk eyed Jews.—! The objects
                for sale were fine, however. We haggled
                until I got tired; &amp; made some purchases.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Finally we struck for the Caravansary
                bridge, which Julia has described, where we
                ate <span class="sic">rahatlikum[sic]</span> with our lemonade.
                We gave some to the children, who kissed
                their hands to us. Great cypresses &amp;
                turbaned tombs overshadow the
               
               
               
               
               
                <span class="sic">cemetary[sic]</span> in part of the large umbrageous,
                oakleaved Sycamore under which we
                repose. The large castle upon the mount
                above, strikes us as a work of great
                power &amp; strength. Poor dogs lie around —
                a foretaste of Constantinople. The
                crescent &amp; the star guards the Entrance
                to our resort. The hair of the women who
                surround us (Jews) hangs long &amp; intermixed. The camels go by, directed by a
                man sitting cross legged on a donkey.
                Black slaves are seen turbaned to
                death; moving in indolent state.
                5 quartered sheep were here seen —
                What Singular tails! Bass wood
                grew about us. The air was soft &amp;
                bland.— We moved away through
                narrow streets, meeting the ladies in the
                white veils all enmeshed but the Eyes.
                The other costumes were very gorgeous.
                Soon we were aboard; and in fair
                way for the Dardenelles. It is about as
                wide as the Mississippi — a strong
                current beats against the boat. Beautiful towns spread on either side of the
                continents of Europe &amp; Asia. At
                last the sun goes down, leaving us in the
                midst of the current. The morning of July
                2<sup>d</sup> found us nearing the city of

            <p>
                Let us recur for a moment to Smyr. Its parting view is worth a word.
                It lies along a slope hill-side. On the right
                hand, is a large grove of cypress, pointing
                out the cemetery. The roofs are brown;
                the minarets ascend from amidst them
                &amp; the round domes.— The large castle
                sweeps the circular view. The 
                deep shadows line the coasts. The
                city lifts itself up large &amp; handsome at
                a distance; from the green bay which
                curls all over with white caps. The 
                city has that dreamy look which
                belongs to Asiatic scenery and customs.
               
               
            </p>
            
            <p>        
               
                Soon we were running out of Smyrna
                between mainland &amp; Mytyline   
               (Lesbos) 
                birth place of Sappho — quite a rocky
                isle — The valleys raise wine;  Lesbos              
                was the rival of Rhodes 
               &amp; Athens. The
                Ancients were corrupt. Persians held
                it once. Venetians then Mahomedans, now Turks. We saw Tenedos also, &amp; 
               Lemnos,—Tenedos, where
                the Greeks hid at Troy;  
               M<sup>t</sup> Athos,
                4000 ft high towered up beyond
                Lemnos, from the point of Turkish
                promontory. Soon we weathered
               
                              
               
               
               
                the point &amp; entered the staits of
                Dardanelles. We stopped two hours
                at the Town: Ran near the shore.
                The land was fine, rolling &amp; cultivated on both Sides. We went to
                bed, while the boat worked up.
                In the morng of July 2<sup>d</sup> we found
                ourselves opposite fine little towers,
                well built towers from furnaces.
                Soon the city of the Moslem came in
                view. It dissappointed us at first. The
                fog hung over it; &amp; the City looked
                so indifferent. Not so, when leaving the Sea of <span class="sic">Marmora[sic]</span>, we passed between Scutari in Asia &amp;
                Const. in Europe in the Bosphorus
                &amp; round into the Golden Horn.
                The Seraglio rose in fine Oriental 
                Style; while the Armory &amp; the 
                Mosque of S<sup>t</sup> Sophia 
               &amp; Sulieman
                glistened &amp; towered finely. But what 
                a contrast when we were landed by the 
                sharp pointed boat at the quay.
                Dirt, dogs and slovens! "Dirty
                Dickie", was a sign we saw first. 
                Narrow — up hill &amp; hard — poor paved streets  
               
                              
               
               
               
                with no carriages or waggons, - poor
                donkeys &amp; men carry all. We
                left Philo to attend to our baggage
                then went to Hotel D'Anglaterre —
                after washing up saw M<sup>r</sup>

                our consul, — was very <em>very</em> polite. Went to the bazaars,— saw all 
                classes in their peculiar costumes,
                Jews, Arminians &amp; Persians. The latter
                with long, sugar loaf, curly black hats;
                The Turks take it easiest in their big
                turbans.— Was not very well — went to 
                bed early. Julia &amp; I both staied at

            Constantinople
            July 3<sup>d</sup>/51.     
            
            
            
            
            <p>
                Went to the Mosques — after waiting
                some time for a firman which our
                Consul who had called—promised us and
                in connection with several others —
                French, Jews, &amp; English we started 
                for Constantinople proper — crossed
                in one of the neat long painted punts
                the Golden Horn—; waited a long 
                time in a café; finally along came
                firman &amp; officer with sword. Went
                thro:  Seraglio. First visited the outer
                court —. Put on extra shoes; the 
               
                                          
               
               
               
                ladies taking off theirs a — funny set
                we were — went thro' the gold fretted rooms. the marble palaces,
                the rooms were roofed with splendid
                many shaped glass—, fountains in 
                which gold fishes shone &amp; swam —
                Elegant couches &amp; ottomans; every where
                told us of the Dreamy Orient. We
                went into the Harem. The birds
                had flown — The wicker cage was
                there still, &amp; the long galley in
                which were landscapes of every 
                Scene — a gift to the Sultan by 
                Raschid Pasha,— where the Sultanas
                aired — finally we came into 
                splendid flower &amp; fruit gardens tastefully arbored &amp; arched
                with the green architecture in 
                multiform beauty on every side
                the walls were greened; the walls
                beflowered: the kind Turks permitted Julia to carry away a 
                fine boquet. We then went to the 
                National Armory. The arms are
                elegantly stacked after, the fashion
               
                                          
               
               
               
                of the Turks, pointing like the
                minarets. Old arms were there,
                Old Turkish Knights in armor.
                We then started for the mosques..
                While waiting in expectancy of admission we were hailed with 
                the appearance of a black slave
                with a whip, who told our firman
                &amp; the Officer sent by the Prime 
                Minister  "<q><em>to go to hell</em>, that they
                   brought the <span class="sic">Gaiours[sic]</span>

                   the time was <span class="sic">Ramadzin[sic]</span></q>" — a 
                holy month, in which the Turks
                fast &amp; sleep all day; &amp; smoke
                &amp; eat all night. He Whipped
                the firman — We left. —!
               
                Tried another. — ditto —! 4
                Gave up mosque seeing in <span class="sic">Ramadzin[sic]</span> time.        
               
               
            </p>
            
            <p>   
               
                Our Consul called of us to 
                go &amp; see the "Sweet Waters
                of Europe," which is a very beautiful valley, with trees in it. The 
                hills are all bare; so that the 
                valley is somewhat of a beauty.
               
                      
               
               
               
                We drove apast a beautiful little
                Summer marble palace of the
                Sultan &amp; his Sultanas. The
                "Sweet waters" flow over marble
                steps &amp; apast the palace. Another is farther down. Our carriage
                (they are rare, are carriages,)
                drove down to the next palace —
                Then up upon the Jews' buryground,
                white  with tombs — <em> [Quod quie?] </em> — (Jewish
                custom, rise in Jehoshaphat.) There are
               
                no trees on it. The view was splendid
                of Asia &amp; Europe; with the Bosphorus, Mamara, &amp; the Golden Horn;
                &amp; the Cities of Parea, Scutari &amp;
               
                Const. between. The tall mosques
                with minarets, domes &amp; their unique
                cast lent a charm ineffable
                to the view, under the golden sun
                setting. The first  
               mosque of the Turks
                was upon this hill; It commemorates
                the first prayer said, by the followers of the Prophet in this
                vicinity.⁓ We visited today, the 
               
                      
               
               
               
                tomb of the former Sultan Mahmoud:
                It is a great affair — gorgeous &amp;
                splendid — Mammoth wax candles stand at the head of the
                richly ornamented tombs, hung
                with splendid shawls &amp; surrounded 
                by mother of pearl work. The
                symbolic extinguisher was upon
                the Candle. His family lies around.
                A few praying <span class="sic">Musselmen[sic]</span>
                were in the splendid building.
                We took off our shoes here too. I
                forgot to mention about our passing the line of Soldiery, waiting 
                for the Sultan. We stopped too to
                see. The cry is "<q>Lo! he cometh.</q>"
                Music strikes up — Pashas with 
                slaves are on the look out.
                We stood before one. Clever fellows some — especally that one (a
                Bey) we got acquainted with
                on the Boat &amp; with whom I 
                got thick. Well — a few officers came, &amp; a prophet of Mecca,
                the first in the Mahomedan 
                church dressed in green very 
               
                      
               
               
               
                finely, with a splendid turban of 
                white &amp; red. He rode finely —
                had a high forehead — very — face 
                long &amp; sorrowful. — a great
                great man, rather black;
                but he looked finely. No
                Sultan appeared.   
               
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               
                After driving along the road
                apast the <span class="sic">Arminian[sic]</span> grave yard, 
                used for promenades &amp; places 
                of amusement here — we turned again into the narrow streets, &amp;
                went homeward.   
               
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               
                I learned much from our Consul about law of descent, law
                of inheritance as to the ruler —
                as to the Courts — as to the constitution — laws of property, free &amp;
                mortgaged; — as to the political 
                movements, Russian &amp; French,
                &amp; as to things to be bought.

                Late supper — finished Journal,

                a splendiferous big negro, with 
                a slave &amp; bearing an elegant 
                sword. His lip was at least 
                a <em>lb.</em>—!

                Still at Constantinople. We started for
                the Bazaars — made purchases; were
                followed by a Jew — <em>which Philo paid</em>.
                Bought many wonders; then went over
                to Asia, — saw the new palace of
                white that is building on the head waters of the Bosphorus; reached the winter palace of the Sultan, saw his slaves
                &amp; eunuchs by hundreds — heard one squeak,
                like a baby. Just got to the quay
                in time to see the Sultan descend
                from the mosque &amp; mount his white
                charger. He looked pale, darkeyed,
                indolent, but carried himself
                well. The officers allowed us to
                stand in front. Oh! but the music
                was fine. — We returned; Amidst
                the wavy clarency of the whitest
                clearest water in the world, the
                gulls swam about. I left for
                the hotel; the others to shop.
                Wrote to Medary.— Julia wrote to
                Father. — Observed the Scribes
               
                      
               
               
               
                on the streets, writing for the people,—
                Also observed the petitions going
                on after the crowd which conducted the Sultan.<a name="pU11" class="notePointer"></a><a href="#nU11" class="annotation" title="In A Buckeye Abroad, Cox identifies the current Sultan as Abd-ul-Mejid (209)."><sup class="noteAnchor">43</sup></a> The Sultanas
                were hid behind the lattice of
                the large Seraglio. Poor fellows!
                They looked bad at the Ramazan
                while sowing. At night the 
                air was filled by drum beating
                and carousing. Dogs did 
                not make so much noise, 
                as I expected.

                French, <em>Germans</em> 
               &amp;<sup>c</sup>. Went
                to the back door; at last got
                entrance at the back door; a turbaned Turk opened the door; We 
                put on our shoes, went around
                a winding way up into the
                large galleries of St. Sophia!
                It is larger; but not equal to
                S<sup>t</sup> Peters 
               The great dome is an <span class="sic">elipise[sic]</span>,
                a round dome loftier, opens in
                it, and is yellow colored. The
                marble pillars, &amp; great green

                angels at the angles of the 
                dome,— were the principle things
                to be seen. The dome was lofty;
                but not very striking. Altogether
                there was great cry &amp; little
                wool. Did not see any

            <br> On board Austrian steamer  
             Imperatore, July 7. <sup>th</sup> 1851.
            
            
            <p>
                We lie at Smyrna, just 
                waiting to go ashore &amp; to take
                a bath. We had a fine view 
                of the city of Const. as we
                left. The sun set so cosily on 
                the city. Dolphins played around
                us &amp; porpoises jumped about.
                The sea was fine — distance grew
                into charm, &amp; charm into enchantment as we bade the
               
                      
               
               
               
                lovely scenes at distance farewell.
                I commenced my closing letter about
                Constantinople: have just finished &amp;
                am well satisfied with it. Hope 
                <em>Col. M.</em> will be. We have taken our
                bath. How I can depicture it? Following Abraham from street to street,
                at last we entered a stone building
                in which was a hot furnace. We there had
                to strip; a cloth was thrown about 
                me; &amp; elevated on wooden shoes I walked
                over the stony floor into another 
               apartment, which was full of heated air. The
                top was lighted by numerous little
                windows; we sat down upon a 
                stone platform, after first wetting
                the place to keep off the cockroaches.
                The air was close &amp; hard to breathe at
                first: it gradually became tolerable
                as the sweat oozed from every pore, trickling down as that fountain of honeycomb
                in the harem. Each hair drooped pearls
                of sweat. The attendant <em>dressed</em> as
                we were, was in similar beady condition — For 20 minutes we sat — an
                Embodied ooziness. The nose was 
                pendant like an Otaheitan
               <a name="pU20" class="notePointer"></a><a href="#nU20" class="annotation" title="Cox is probably using (and misspelling) a now obsolete term for Tahitian (OED)."><sup class="noteAnchor">44</sup></a> with a gem 
                therein. The ears were tremulous &amp; dancing in their prismatic drops. The 
                forehead gleamed with its coronel. A
               
                      
               
               
               
                delicious dreaminess begins to overcreep the senses: We lie down in
                the sweet delirium. Streams creep from
                the little round drop to drop; until there 
                is one entirely of perspiration. The
                attendant directs us to another smaller
                room, where out of two spigots there
                plays into marble basins, warm &amp;
                cold water, the former predominant.
                By it, we sit down still dripping in
                the heated air. The attendant rubs us
                with glove hand with warm water,
                which is grateful &amp; good. He pours
                bowl on bowl over the entranced body
                until the frame almost <em>chills</em> with
                delight. The head forms the point
                from which the dripping water falls
                all around. A soft &amp; pleasant sensation comes over the mind; not intense
                &amp; thrilling; but mellowed &amp; tender as
                a sunset would produce or a
                picture of Murillo.  
               Soon P &amp; I 
                began to throw the warm water at
                each other; in the mean time the sweat
                running, &amp; the sensation robbing
                the body of all save enjoyment.
                The attendant then makes a bowl
                of soap suds white as the drapery
               
                      
               
               
               
                of a Vestal, &amp; with closed eyes, we
                are veiled &amp; robed in the flowing
                &amp; warm drapery. Oh! how solacing
                &amp; sweet it seemed to feel the warm
                thrill dart to the heart. After being
                washed over, — from top to toe, every
                particle of dirt taken off — we
                drip again for some minutes, &amp; are 
                soon covered in soft white long
                towels, over the shoulders, around 
                the waist &amp; with a larger turban on
                the head, we looked like a very 
                luxurious old Sensous Turk in
                one of the baths of the palace.
                Thus arrayed, almost dreamy with
                delight, we are taken into the
                first apartment, where cross legged 
                sit on ottomans &amp; warm quilts &amp;
                supported by pillows, the Turks
                &amp; Greeks who have been our companions to this Elysium. We try
                the cross legged custom. But soon
                I sing out —"<q>Cover that limb—I
                   am a Christian &amp; can't go it."</q>
                Philo remarked "<q>that the fellow
                   would make a fortune in NY.</q>"
                "<q>Dont talk Philo!</q>""<q>How do you
                   feel Sam</q>" — Oh! in Elysium—.
               
                      
               
               
               
                How do you feel—?" "Sleepy"—So do
                I?" Don't let—us—c-o-n-ve—rse
                a-n-y."— &amp; sinking back in
                a pillow, I find myself gradually
                transformed into an Ottoman seeking an Oriental heaven; The
                mind seemed to take bright colored
                wings which waved so lazily in a
                sort of gold-lustrous &amp; purple air,
                thin &amp; delicious to <span class="sic">breath[sic]</span>. My
                own breathing through partly opened
                mouth seemed as gentle as an
                infant's. The ear was filled with an
                undertone of dreamy music, hardly
                distinguishable "in joint or member."
                The Eye began to see rich gorgeous
                clouds &amp; found the beauteous Eye of
                heaven garnished, as the clouds
                lazily parted &amp; I winged  my
                way through &amp; upward. "Sabian
                odors from the spicy shores" of
                the Enchanted place began to
                be inhaled.

                Oh! what a Joy it was
                To have a body, —
               
                And to these elements surrender it
                As it were a Spirit."

                The wanton Spring of some new star
                seemed to pour its blooming honors
                upon the rapt sense—Smooth and
                flowery paths invited below; but
                the mind <em>would</em> assume a wavy
                motion upward—upward—to soft
                &amp; languid allurements—which were 
                not only seemed—the echo of a
                dream, nay the shadow of a dream
                dissipating gradually before the
                returning sense aroused to its Earthly
                existence by P's exclamation. "<q>Its
                   time to go Abraham</q>!"

                Dressing—we left. What a sensuous
                dreamy, delicious luxury these
                Turks have; but Americans never
                will have time (2 hours) for
                such. ⁓ A white winged ship flew
                by our stern, a magic thing!

                Saw to day a funeral of a
                Greek. The monks looked &amp; sang
                like Catholics somewhat. The
                body was exposed, yet dressed in
                the Coffin, flowers in it. Grapes are
                ripe here, &amp; fruit plenty. A caravan arrived to day. Plenty of

                Wrote to Alex this morning by

                about this Greek who has been
                away 14 yrs from his home (Smyrna) &amp; is just returning. He has
                been to Cholchis after Jason &amp;
                following Xenophon in his
                Retreat. A great traveller!
                He told us quite a Story about
                the robbers <em>politely</em> robbing his
                mother. We are soon to bid the
                Orient 'good bye." Do not regret
                Coming hither. Sorry to give up
                Jerusalem. Was in hopes to have
                said with the prophet "Our feet
                stand within thy gates Oh! Jerusalem!" and to have sung
                with the poet:
                
               
               "Jerusalem my happy home,
                Name ever dear to me,
                When shall my labors have an end,
                In joy, in peace in thee."
               
               
                Must be satisfied with that
                buryground at Const. &amp; the
                sight of the Jews there &amp; Here.

                 P.M., where 150 natives came aboard to go
                 up to fete at Corfu. Such a hubbub. Passed into sight of Cephalonia &amp; between

               We are coming into Trieste. Last night
               had such a splendid sunset, went up
               to see it, come in — on a run. The Adriatic
               on a high swell; was a gale the other
               Night, did not get over. The sunset
               made the waves glow like fiery gold!
               Have finished all our letters; shall be
               in Trieste at 3; It is 12 M.  The sea is
               calm. So I am. ⁓

               We had to wait some time for <span class="sic">practique[sic]</span>; finally were safely <span class="sic">esconced[sic]</span> in Hotel National.
               Dinner ate, we took a carriage, &amp; altho' it
               <em>was</em> sunday, had a fine stroll or drive
               through the <span class="sic">ctity[sic]</span>; was much surprized at the
               neatness of the city — the streets were well
               paved; the houses of white stone; Soldiers not
               so very common. We drove around to the
               East, along the Adriatic — an exquisite
               drive — others were out. Everybody out on
               Sunday, either prominading or riding. —
               <span class="sic">Gayety[sic]</span> seems to prevail, — Returned — passed
               some fine fountains with sculpture; then
               went further along up a valley (in which
               the city is built) where Music greeted
               the ear &amp; hill slopes, very high, of oaks
               
               
               
               
               
               were filled with <span class="sic">gaily[sic]</span> dressed people.
               The ladies here are very handsome,
               the gent. well dressed. It was a singular
               sight, to see <em>Germans</em> &amp; Italians, 
               Russian Soldiers &amp; Austrian, peasants &amp;
               merchants, all mingling in the shouts &amp;
               Joy of a Sunday night.  <em>Where is God?</em>
               <em>Where is Religion?</em> It seems to be a negative
               quantity.  We heard the guns of a steamer
               &amp; the shouts of the Crowd without. Perhaps
               the guns were from the Independence
               or Mississippi, which we saw lying in the gulf
               as we entered. The Scene on the hill was
               around a café, — A band was
               making fine music; the people were eating
               ices &amp;c some of them were smoking; others
               lolling around upon the grass. The
               walks rose higher &amp; higher under the
               oaks — &amp; was filled. — Shall not forget
               Trieste on a/c of this novel Sight.
               The other cafés were also full. ⁓

               We left on 14<sup>th</sup> for Venice at 6 Am.
               got up at ½ past 4. Now onboard.
               The city of Trieste looked fine under
               its green hills — its fine villas, the cultivation about, its red roofed fine
               buildings. The Sea is a little rough.
               Anytime along these coasts one may
               see mountains. The Tyrol lies off
               under a mist, now, but was plainly
               
               
               
               
               
               discernible this morig. The clouds
               hung upon their sides. Snow seams
               glittered on them. — We were right 
               glad to get over our Sea voyage. It 
               was long &amp; tedious. Hope soon to be
               off for good. Venice towers up in
               the distance rising out of the Sea. At
               first it seemed like a few straggling
               cypresses. — A few sail are on the sea.
               The  [divers?]  mounts beyond Venice, wonder
               what they are? Towers &amp; cupolas rise now
               more plainly: In an hour we shall
               be in the lagoon &amp; lying at the base
               of S<sup>t</sup> Mark's! The spirit of the Old
               Doges support me in the trying 
               hour.

               A little behind; must bring up. Arrived yesterday at 2 PM;  got a gondola, &amp;
               landed at <span class="sic">Doniera's[sic]</span> hotel; took dinner
               then visited S<sup>t</sup> Mark's, — Saw the lion, &amp; the
               two pillars; examined the Church in golden
               Mosaic, &amp; fine marbles &amp; stones. After
               sundown, went down to the Rialto in
               a gondola — fine time, lights dancing, —
               music on our return shortcut: <span class="sic">bot[sic]</span>
               things, —, heard a great band in the large
               piazza. Went to bed at 10. after writing to Medary &amp; catching cold; to get
               up at 5 in the Morning.

               Got up early — took a ride down the Canal
               apast orange groves &amp; saw Arsenal.
               It rained — we returned, wrote till breakfast. Visited Ducal palace; saw the
               Venetian School of paintings — one fine
               one of Titian — Saw Council room of the 
               "Ten" — Saw prisons by lamp light; passed
               over the Bridge of <span class="sic">Sigh[sic]</span> — must not forget the Library &amp; the old Globe with
               the "<em>Floridas</em>." — Went to S<sup>t</sup> Mark's, then
               up the Tower &amp; saw all <em>Venice</em>.
               Fine view of tiles &amp; domes. Venice looked
               as isle. No canals seem. It rained good.
               We expect a good parting view of the City, as
               we ride up to the rail road.

            <p>
               Arrived here at 8 in the cars over a splendid
               road. We had a fine ride in a gondola
               to the Station, &amp; after meeting some difficulties which <span class="sic">Dominicho[sic]</span> solved by
               
               his genius, we were on our way. The
               train of the Elector of Saxony &amp; Queen
               started just before ours. He stopped at our
               Hotel, beat us at the Tower this morng,
               &amp; is in many respects an energetic fellow.
               His aid was so "tricked with Art
               That of himself he was least part.
               The Queen sat in a royal chair: they
               dashed by so hurriedly that we could
               not get a good view. However we
               were soon in chase over the 3 mile bridge.

            Venice — Verona —
            
            
            
            <p>  
               Venice was left behind, and after getting out of the marshy land, we struck
               into the garden of gardens — the splendid
               level country which lies between the
               Tyrol and the Adriatic. Mulberries festooned with vines, hung one from the
               other made vistas of exceding beauty.
               The trees all seemed joined in greenly
               hands &amp; ready to dance jubilant
               at the merry grape gushing Season.
               This part of Italy is the <em>ubere</em>
               <em>glebae</em> of the poet. The succession
               of rich product was unbroken. All
               nature was inwoven in green texture.
               So neat &amp; spruce too.  Southern Italy,
               France &amp; England — where are ye now?
               We passed several towns before Padua,
               celebrated is Padua for Baldus the
               professor, the University &amp; the Duomo of Angelo. Saw the latter. It was
               a greenish city for so large. <span class="sic">Vincensa[sic]</span> was linked to Padua by
               the same green bands. The ploughed
               fields between the lines of trees, or
               the harvesting. The second crop was
               being ploughed for — Viz, millet. Soon the
               eye was on the look out for Verona. <span class="sic">Vicensa[sic]</span> was on the lofty hill — a beautiful place — so lofty yet verdant, so
               fortified &amp; romantic. It began to rain.
               The hills of the Tyrol were swathed
               in a cloud of mist — or rain. The
               other hills toward Ferrara were
               green as — Emeralds under the shower.
               The willows turned white in the breeze along the Adigo.
               We looked for the obelisk which
               marks the battle of Arcoli — the place
               where Nap. got away from his gaurds, &amp;
               was surrounded, where Lannes was desperately wounded in the swamps; &amp; the
               cry of <q>"Save the General"</q>," brot out the
               child of Destiny. Julia said she
               saw the obelisk. The Adigo flowed by
               the gate of the Boscarre received us at
               Verona — The <q>"two gentlemen"</q> of W<sup>m</sup>
               Shakespeare were walking in the
               rain. — Dominique grows useful. We
               go at ½ past 9 in the <span class="sic">Dilligence[sic]</span>.

            Milan July 16/51.
            
            
            
            
            <p>
               This morng broke &amp; found us in Brescia, 
               a fine city — the seat of Chev. Bayard's
               adventures; Leaving it we threaded
               our way thro' a fertile &amp; irrigated Country into the vernal heart of Lombardy,
               untill we at last reached here at
               4 P.M. The noticable objects along this way
               from Venice  to Milan 
               were many. Indeed it
               is a <span class="sic">gardee[sic]</span>, not run to seed, but in the very
               
               
               
               
               
               height of cultivation &amp; luxuriance. We saw
               women working the corn fields &amp; vineyards
               between the mulbery rows. Silk is the 
               <span class="sic">principle[sic]</span> product. At every town, the 
               women serve the reel &amp; untwist from
               the silkworm's tomb the glossy fibre.
               Cocoons in great quantities are seen
               through the windows. Old fashioned
               overshot wheels are turned by mountain
               streams all walled in against an
               overflood.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               As we pass the <span class="sic">woman[sic]</span> in big hats
               look up &amp; lean on spade, pondering
               our appearence. The harvest was in. Before we passed into <span class="sic">Treveglio[sic]</span> we saw
               men flailing out the grain. Shrines <em>lit</em>
               lined the way. Big loaded 2 wheeled
               waggons, all dusty, with 5 horses drawing
               great loads of wine, were met, the
               drivers were under the load.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               We enter the fine station at Treviglio, where taking something to eat,
               we got into the cars. The car — arrangments are fine. The bell taps,
               the baggage is put on — Tap! &amp; the 
               door opens, &amp; 1<sup>st</sup> Class enter; Tap!
               &amp; 2<sup>d</sup> class — no difficulty or rush.
               Soon we are on our way to Milan.
               The road was lined with locusts, &amp;
               it was hard to see the view. Bergamo
               was toward the Alps.
               
               
               
               
               
               Lodi to our South, we crossed the Adra
               and soon were in the outskirts of Milan.
               We entered the Posta gate, drove
               under long promenades of seeming Buckeyes to the <em>Hotel de Ville</em>; a splendid one.
               Forthwith went to the Duoma — the greatest Church yet, with its thousands of
               minarets &amp; Gothic points. It was superexcellent within &amp; without. Awful &amp;
               grand. It takes 12 years to wash it, by
               10 men. The yellow palace &amp; the palace of
               Corinthian columns of the Church surround
               it — a long piazza in front. The went atop. It seems a Mountain of Marble. Walks 
               &amp; stairs all around: 145 pinnacles, 42
               (more to be put up) 10,000 statues, 15 thous'd
               different points — botanic garden each point
               different. It cost 682 millions of <span class="sic">frances[sic]</span>,
               Saw fine Statue of the founder, of Adam &amp; Eve,
               Indeed every niche &amp; pinnacle has a form.
               We were up 222 ft. Grace Church N.Y.
               is on top. — We could not but glance about us
               to see Milan now in its prime — went on 
               every side. The Alps were not — tho' gererally
               visible. Went to the Arena, piazza d' Armi, buildings by Napoleon — to a church of 16
               old columns, drove about the city. This
               fine &amp; 12 miles round. Visited the Bazaar,        
               went to bed to get of at 4 o'clock,
               when we started for Como by Rail
               Road — of which I speak on the 
               other page.

            Como Lake.
            July 18/51.
            
                         
            
            <p>
               We are for a sail on the lake of
               Beauty. Passing between 2 large piers
               with Madonna statues, we enter the
               clear water. Above us in garb of
               green, specked with white houses, are
               the monts. Little red steamers around.
               Many colored houses around us in green.
               The hills are terraced off in most romantic beauty. An old castle, with broken top rises from a green hill. Peaks of 
               verdure around us. Boats with faggots are
               coming in sawed by women &amp; the wood
               weighed. Companies of women are washing on the shore. The air is clear. The hill
               in front radiating up from the point
               lose their tops in the clouds. Red tower
               looks out on the Lake. Truly this is the 
               spot for Pauline to love or Claude to
               picture. Music from the fort comes
               over the water, &amp; the sound of the drum
               reverberates.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
                [How?]  bountifully has heaven hung this
               liquid gallery with landscapes, whose tops
               are lined in clouds — Every variety of
               land &amp; water view are here painted.
               Groves of <span class="sic">maytle[sic]</span> seem to cluster &amp; golden fruitage are reflected in the lake
               near perpendicular strata. The chimes
               are rung from the city. Como seems to be 
               in the lake, so low in its green setting.
               We reach the point; the Villa is at the
               
               
               
               
               
               far end,  [upon?]  a perspective of beautiful
               hills. Here we are in the midst of the 
               perfection of Lake Scenery. All around
               us is the green hills, — shrines for pilgrims,
               Erratic blocks of granite are upon

               Our ride from Milan was fine
               Did not see much of Monza,
               though we much desired to visit
               the Iron crowm &amp; the relics of
               the Queen Theolinda. We
               saw  yesterday from the Duoma,
               that is Monza.

               unbroken succession of beautiful
               hills—green with vines &amp; mulberries.
               The peasant women, many of them
               have unsightly protuberances on 
               the neck. The dresses of the

                Journal, bought at Milan
                with the Alps, of which we
                hope to have a good sight
                tomorrow. Two months ago, we
                left Liverpool. What an an
                era in our lives has  period
                been. How much of the round
                Earth has been seen! What has
                it bought us? Humility, Charity
                Kindness &amp; Tenderness, No,
                these are plants, which grow in
                the shade of home, not the sun
                &amp; air of the World. It is to be 
                hoped that the gentler virtues &amp;
                the primal duties will be better
                cultivated hereafter in our own
                homes. We have thus far, Julia &amp;
                myself spent about $1000,—which
                includes all our purchases. We
                have been free in our expenditure.
                I prize most our paintings at
                Rome &amp; Views of Naples. My little
                 [?]  of Constantinople is my
                pet however. It came the
                farthest way. The sweets of
               
               
               
                Smyrna ought to be Julia's — In
                consideration of all the past, may
                we not be thankful to Him who
                has kept our goodly Company
                in health — &amp; my <em>own wife</em>
                in such excellent spirits &amp; neverceasing Kindness. she has been
                Every near me in gallery, in palace,
                in hall &amp; in garden. Am I
                not glad that she has had this
                never (perhaps) recurring opportunity of seeing the great old
                places of the great old past  [?] of
                the Great of Old! May our
                Memory of these scenes —

            date of the journal entries in this notebook. In his entry for July 18, 1851, he reports
            that he purchased a second journal in Milan,
            but that journal has not been located.<a href="#pN1215" class="annotation">

            The <em>Asia</em> was built in 1850 
            for the British and North American Royal Mail Steam Packet Company
            (renamed the Cunard Steam Ship Co. Ltd. in 1878) by R. Steele &amp; Son
            of Greenock, Scotland. It was a wooden-hulled paddlewheeler, 266 feet long by 40 wide,
            with a gross tonnage of 2,226 
            and an indicated horse-power 2,150, making it, along with its sister ship
            <em>Africa</em> (built by Steele &amp; Son the same year), the largest ship at the time 
            in the Cunard fleet (Swiggum and Kohli; Hyde 326–327). The <em>Asia</em> departed
            on its maiden voyage, from Liverpool to New York, on May 18, 1850 (Solem and Austheim).<a href="#pN320Asia" class="annotation">

         <p class="hang15"><a name="nMiscalc"></a>3.&nbsp;Cox miscalculates the total miles, which
            add up to 2738, using the figures in his transcription of the ship's log.<a href="#pMiscalc" class="annotation">

         <p class="hang15"><a name="npenink"></a>4.&nbsp;The text of Cox's journal contains
            sections written in pencil, sections written in ink, and sections in which text
            written originally in pencil is overwritten (and, in a very few cases, altered)
            in ink. Based on the headings and content of the journal entries, we assume
            that the original text of Cox's journal was written in pencil when he was
            onboard a ship at sea (perhaps to avoid spilling ink) and in ink when he was on
            land or on a ship lying at anchor. The penciled passages overwritten in ink
            were presumably composed at sea and overwritten later, perhaps to create a copy
            less prone to fading. Because the pencil and superimposed ink copies of
            passages vary so little, we have not indicated the differences in the displayed
            text, but differences between the pencil and ink text have been encoded, and we
            provide a button allowing readers to display each version.<a href="#ppenink" class="annotation">

            monkey, or the melancholy of a gibed cat, there is no more melancholy creature in

         <p class="hang25"><a name="nC0513berg"></a>10.&nbsp;Judging from the mileage recorded in its log, the <em>RMS Asia</em>
            probably encountered icebergs while running near the "Flemish Cap" of the Grand Banks
            off the Newfoundland coast.
            In <cite>The Physical Geography of the Sea</cite> (1855), M.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;Maury
            describes the contemporary understanding of the currents that carry icebergs to the
            coast of Newfoundland:
            "cold waters, as they come down from the Arctic Ocean through Davis's Straits, press
            upon the warm waters 
            of the Gulf Stream, and curve their channel into a horse-shoe. . . . This 'bend' is
            the great receptacle of 
            the icebergs which drift down from the north" (241–42).

         <p class="hang25"><a name="nN823Paci"></a>11.&nbsp;The <em>Pacific</em> belonged to the Collins
            Line, which competed for the Atlantic trade in the years following 1849. It and its
            sister
            ships, the <em>Arctic</em>, <em>Baltic</em>, and
            <em>Atlantic</em>, were somewhat larger than the <em>Asia</em>
            at 282 feet, with a gross tonnage of 2,800 and an indicated horse-power of 2,000.
            While
            the lines' competition extended to passenger accommodations and rates charged for
            freight,
            the speed of the Atlantic crossing especially caught the public's imagination (Babcock
            92–95).

            Samuel Medary was referred to as Colonel Samuel Medary. 
            This article also states that Colonel Samuel Medary was granted the postmastership in 
            Columbus, Ohio. Samuel Medary's

         <p class="hang25"><a name="noopsy"></a>30.&nbsp;Cox corrects this dateline twice, crossing out "Friday"
            and overwriting the "4" in "24" with a "3," resulting in an impossible date of
            Thursday, May 23, 1851. Judging from the dates of other entried, the dateline
            should probably read Thursday, May 22, 1851 ("Calendar").<a href="#poopsy" class="annotation">

               And love Earth only for its earthly sake? /
               By the blue rushing of the arrowy Rhone, /
               Or the pure bosom of its nursing lake, /
               Which feeds it as a mother who doth make /
               A fair but froward infant her own care, /
               Kissing its cries away as these awake-- /
               Is it not better thus our lives to wear, /
               Than join the crushing crowd, doom'd to inflict or bear?"

         <h2 style="text-align:center;">About this View of the Journal</h2>
         <hr>
         <p><a name="view"></a>This presentation of the Cox journal derives from the
            project's main XML file, sscox_journal.xml, transformed with sscox_Common.xsl and
            sscox-Reading.xsl. In this "view" of the Cox journal, line breaks in the
            manuscripts are not reported; rather, lines wrap in the browser's window. Similarly,
            page
            breaks are not reported. Paragraph breaks follow those in the manuscript. Spelling,
            punctuation, capitalization, and abbreviations are reported as they appear in the
            manuscript. Text highlighted by the correspondents with an underscore is underscored
            in this
            view. Canceled text is suppressed. Text added between lines or in the margins is silently
            incorporated into the reading text. All material added by the editors is surrounded
            by
            square brackets: uncertain readings are enclosed in square brackets and followed by
            a
            question mark, and text supplied by the editor for clarity is set in italics and surrounded
            by square brackets. Gaps in the manuscript (e.g., from tears) are indicated by elipses
            enclosed by square brackets. Links to notes and external materials are colored.

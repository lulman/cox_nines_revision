1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.730
I'm going to look at the folds

2
00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.730
here where the sewing is going to go through again,

3
00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.690
and as you see, this fold is in pretty good shape,

4
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.688
as are the rest of the sheets in this section

5
00:00:16.708 --> 00:00:20.980


6
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.400
where they are folded around. 

7
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:24.980
They are in pretty good condition.

8
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.360
The sewing holes are not torn out 

9
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.480
or opened up or widened or anything.

10
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.560
They are the way they were 

11
00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.480
when it was originally sewn.

12
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.360
So the only one that really is damaged,

13
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.690
again, is the outer fold.

14
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.150
That's because it was on the spine.

15
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.560
It had the leather glued right to it,

16
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:50.522
and the leather had caused some deterioration.

17
00:00:50.542 --> 00:00:50.600


18
00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.400
Of course, that's where most of the wear and tear is,

19
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.270
and it just breaks down there.

20
00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.690
So it is a combination of having the adhesives there

21
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.600
-the leather glued right to it-

22
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.650
and most of the flexing when the book opens and closes.

23
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.230
We are going to leave that little bit connected right there

24
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.230
and put a thin piece of Japanese paper over this area,

25
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.770


26
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.190
and we want to be careful not to make it so wide

27
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.900
that it covers up any of the printing here.

28
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.440
I mean the writing.

29
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.270
You don't want to use something too lightweight

30
00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.150
and too thin, which if it covered some of the writing

31
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.150
it wouldn't matter

32
00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.480
because you would probably be able to see through it,

33
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.230
but you want something that's fairly strong

34
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.900
because you are going to be sewing through that. 

35
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.897
Again, that's going to be the outer fold,

36
00:01:54.917 --> 00:01:55.400


37
00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.520
so it is kind of a compromise.

38
00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.100
So what I'm going to do is, first of all,

39
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:09.105
I'm going to score this with a needle

40
00:02:09.125 --> 00:02:12.560


41
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.810
just so I can tear it in a fairly straight line

42
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.772
but still have a fairly soft edge

43
00:02:21.792 --> 00:02:22.100


44
00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.060
instead of having a cut edge,

45
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.770
which would act like a breaking edge, you know, 

46
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.400
like a piece of Scotch tape or something.

47
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.397
This is a little more gentle. 

48
00:02:39.417 --> 00:02:45.397


49
00:02:45.417 --> 00:02:51.397


50
00:02:51.417 --> 00:02:57.397


51
00:02:57.417 --> 00:02:59.900


52
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.900
Sometimes this type of tissue is torn with water.

53
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:06.980
You actually take a brush 

54
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.810
and you put a bead of water all along 

55
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.100
a certain line or a shape,

56
00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.600
and the tissue when it's wet it gets very weak.

57
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.770
When it's wet you can tear it 

58
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.770
right along where it's been wetted.

59
00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:20.810
And the same thing here.

60
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.690
Just by scoring it and then tear it,

61
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:29.647
you leave that sort of a softer edge.

62
00:03:29.667 --> 00:03:35.688


63
00:03:35.708 --> 00:03:37.020


64
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.560
Okay. I'm going to paste this up now.

65
00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:44.563
And I have wheat starch paste.

66
00:03:44.583 --> 00:03:50.563


67
00:03:50.583 --> 00:03:56.563


68
00:03:56.583 --> 00:04:02.563


69
00:04:02.583 --> 00:04:07.770


70
00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:13.772
Move it over here . . . on a dry surface there,

71
00:04:13.792 --> 00:04:16.730


72
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:22.730
take my section, and I'll put this down 

73
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:28.730


74
00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.520


75
00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:37.522
covering approximately half the width of the tissue strip,

76
00:04:37.542 --> 00:04:40.440


77
00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:46.438
and I'll use this paper here to fold it over.

78
00:04:46.458 --> 00:04:48.810


79
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:54.813
That's not sticking . . . let's do it by hand.  

80
00:04:54.833 --> 00:05:00.813


81
00:05:00.833 --> 00:05:06.813


82
00:05:06.833 --> 00:05:11.230


83
00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:16.650
This is doing it the hard way.  

84
00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:21.860
It's just such a thin strip 

85
00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.360
[Interviewer]: Especially in a journal like this, 

86
00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.770
where they might have written across the spine.  

87
00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.860
[Campbell]: Yeah, that's the thing that I'm most concerned about.

88
00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:37.855
There's writing right up to the edges of the inner margins. . . .  

89
00:05:37.875 --> 00:05:43.855


90
00:05:43.875 --> 00:05:49.855


91
00:05:49.875 --> 00:05:55.855


92
00:05:55.875 --> 00:05:58.190


93
00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:04.188
I may want to do this one again. 

94
00:06:04.208 --> 00:06:04.810


95
00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.440
And the same on this side. 

96
00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.650
[Interviewer]: That will give you a surface to sew through?  

97
00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:12.690
[Campbell]: It's not really overlapping very far,

98
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:18.688
but when that paste is dry, it will be adequate to,

99
00:06:18.708 --> 00:06:20.480


100
00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.190
you know, that tissue will hold on there

101
00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:26.520
and be well attached to this paper,

102
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.900
and then when we're able to open that up and sew through it,

103
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.940
it will be good strong Japanese . . . 

104
00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.230
long fiber Japanese tissue paper.

105
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:41.520
Right now I'm going to actually put the rest of the section

106
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:47.522
inside there so that it kind of molds to the shape,

107
00:06:47.542 --> 00:06:48.650


108
00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:51.272
the full thickness of the section here. . . .

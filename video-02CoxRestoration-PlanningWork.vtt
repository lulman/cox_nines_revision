00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200
In the midst of treatment of this volume,

2
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.250
it will be scanned
when the volume is taken apart

3
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:16.890
so that we have digital access 
to this, to the pages,

4
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.120
where the book . . . the original artifact . . .

5
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.850
won't have to be handled so much

6
00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:26.570
just for people to basically read the text.

7
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:33.230
Now the treatment that we will be doing

8
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.200
will take that into consideration,

9
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:44.150
and in mid treatment we will stop

10
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.560
and in fact do the scanning.

11
00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.770
As the book is now,

12
00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.210
it would be very difficult to use,

13
00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.130
especially to use the book

14
00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.900
without doing further damage.

15
00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.010
It is very much at risk right now;

16
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.280
it is at a point where it is very vulnerable

17
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.130
to further damage if it . . . with any handling.

18
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:14.270
So it is important at this point to consider

19
00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.200
and to think about stabilizing that

20
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.010
just for the future use of this book as a book.

21
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.630
And that will include all the cover issues

22
00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.370
and all the text block issues, meaning. . . .

23
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.490
the book probably has to be resewn

24
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.680
because all of the outer folds are broken away,

25
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.830
and in fact the sewing is broken

26
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.370
in a number of places, so it is so far gone . . .

27
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.620
it's far enough gone

28
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.020
that it needs to be redone completely.

29
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:56.170
That will make it a good solid working . . .

30
00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.390
mechanically, structurally

31
00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.190
it will work like a book.

32
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.670
In the midst of that we will . . .

33
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.670
since we will have the sewing taken apart

34
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.750
and have all the pages apart as loose leaves,

35
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.590
that's the ideal time to do the scanning

36
00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.760
because they can be handled as flat pages,

37
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.740
and you don't have any structural

38
00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.900
or mechanical issues at that point

39
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.070
that you have to be real careful with.

40
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.660
Some of the work will be done to the text pages

41
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.650
before the scanning is done

42
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.290
so that all of the folds are intact,

43
00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.550
and in fact each section

44
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.190
will be a folded section ready to be sewn.

45
00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.880
It can just be taken one page at a time

46
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.810
and handled in a very delicate way

47
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.640
in a very easy way . . . relatively easy . . .

48
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.496
compared to trying to scan 
the pages of a bound book.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
Not much sewing left here,

2
00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:05.980
but what's there I can go ahead and cut

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.600
from the outside . . . just make it a little easier

4
00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:19.605
to pull it from the inside.

5
00:00:19.625 --> 00:00:20.980


6
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.940
You see how loose it is already,

7
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.810
and you can see the tears 

8
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:32.690
where the folds have come apart as well.

9
00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.730
Again, we have these pages numbered now,

10
00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:42.730
so I will be trying to pay a little bit of attention

11
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.520
to where the center of the signature fold is . . . 

12
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.230
of the section . . . so how many . . . 

13
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.150
essentially how many leaves there are in each section.

14
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.060
It'll make it a little easier

15
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.900
when I'm putting the section back together

16
00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.940
to know which leaves are conjugate

17
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:08.900
with the pages on the other side. 

18
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.360
[Interviewer]: So the goal is 
to have the gathers be identical? 

19
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:21.810
[Campbell]: Yes . . . or like they were originally.

20
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:31.772
So here one, two, three, four, five.

21
00:01:31.792 --> 00:01:41.772


22
00:01:41.792 --> 00:01:44.980


23
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.100
Okay, so that looks like these were five sheets

24
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.560
folded around each other, so it's a signature . . .

25
00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.480
or the section is made up of 10 leaves or 20 pages,

26
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.560
and then sure enough this leaf here,

27
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:07.770
which you might confuse

28
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.310
for a leaf that goes to this section

29
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:18.900
and conjugate with one of these over here,

30
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.440
you can see here that it's still

31
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.480
attached to its conjugate sheet,

32
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:31.100
which is at the back of this signature.

33
00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.810
That gets a little confusing at times

34
00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.730
because of the adhesives.

35
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.270
You know, when the spine is lined,

36
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.690
and the pages get stuck together,

37
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:46.480
and the outer folds are actually 
held more tightly together

38
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:55.150
than the pages within the folds. 

39
00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.810
[Interviewer]: Right. And it looked as though 

40
00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.100
the page was creased in a way 

41
00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.650
that would maybe make you think 

42
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:06.310
it was connected to a different page . . . 

43
00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.860
or the leaf was creased. 

44
00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.600
[Campbell]:See now here, 
this is a little deceiving here.

45
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.980
It's connected and you think okay,

46
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.560
is that leaf conjugate with that?

47
00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.400
Actually, there's no way because this is . . . 

48
00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.650
they wouldn't be conjugate without sewing in between them,

49
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.600
and without other pages in between them.

50
00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.100
What's holding them together is the glue from the spine,

51
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.310
which is what I was just talking about.

52
00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.730
So, basically, to get this page back to where it belongs,

53
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.020
you have to do that

54
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:48.690
so you end up with a full section right here,

55
00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:57.730
and there is the outer fold barely there, 
and then the next.

56
00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.360
The inner folds are in pretty good shape,

57
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.980
which is good, and in fact the sewing holes

58
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.860
are in very good shape.

59
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.600
We'll probably just use the original sewing holes

60
00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.650
and not have to worry about very fragile paper there,

61
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.310
and this is probably, in most cases,

62
00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:17.770
throughout this book, this is probably

63
00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.900
the only fold that will need to be 
mended before it is resewn. 

64
00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.730
[Interviewer]: So if you can avoid piercing the paper again,

65
00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.770
you will, when you sew it. 

66
00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.060
[Campbell]: Sometimes with real brittle paper

67
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.440
or very delicate paper, it is almost better 

68
00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.730
to make a new hole, 

69
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.980
especially if there's some support on the outside,

70
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.650
some repairs that you've done on the outside,

71
00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:44.310
but in a case like this it's definitely better

72
00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:54.313
just to go with the original sewing holes.

73
00:04:54.333 --> 00:04:54.520


74
00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.230
It's connected here, so...

75
00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.400
here's the last leaf of this section right here,

76
00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:07.560
and I'm just going to pop it 
away from this adhesive here . . . 

77
00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:17.563
and there it is. 

78
00:05:17.583 --> 00:05:27.563


79
00:05:27.583 --> 00:05:37.563


80
00:05:37.583 --> 00:05:40.730


81
00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.020
It is still quite flexible 
and pretty robust for what it is,

82
00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:49.560
but still, the linen itself, the fibers, 

83
00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:57.980
don't really last forever. 

84
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:07.980
It's like old clothing. 

85
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:15.310


86
00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:23.690
I've seen some tests of certain fibers and bookbinding cloths

87
00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:27.270
-that sort of thing-comparing linen and cotton 

88
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:32.060
that seem to show that cotton is actually more durable

89
00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.360
in a long run.

90
00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:38.150
It will last longer and hold up more, 

91
00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:41.190
so the long-term endurance. . . . 

92
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:46.690
Again, I'm getting ready to separate this here, 

93
00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:48.230
and that . . . that . . . 

94
00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.190
the reason these are together right here . . . 

95
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:53.190
is the adhesive from the . . . when the spine was . . . 

96
00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:57.730
after it was sewn it was glued up, 

97
00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.860
and the leather was put on, and that adhesive 

98
00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.810
got down in between the sections a little bit 

99
00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:08.860
and basically glues them together. 

100
00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.190
It's sort of consolidates the spine, 

101
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:21.147
and we still use adhesives that way. 

102
00:07:21.167 --> 00:07:31.147


103
00:07:31.167 --> 00:07:31.480


104
00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:34.150
I have a different light here. Is that . . . 

105
00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:35.150
[Interviewer]: That's fine. 

106
00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:45.100
[Campbell]: Okay. Good.

107
00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:53.940
We're down to the very end. 

108
00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:58.900
[Interviewer]: So how many gathers were there? 

109
00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:08.855
[Campbell]: I think ten, but let me count again real quick.

110
00:08:08.875 --> 00:08:18.855


111
00:08:18.875 --> 00:08:20.520


112
00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:26.860
Oh, no. Two, four, six, eight. Yes.

113
00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:35.813
And there are 166- including the paste downs-166 pages.

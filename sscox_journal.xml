                     <p>
                        Samuel Sullivan Cox's "Journal of a Tour to Europe" is a leather-bound
                        notebook approximately 6.5 in. (16.5 cm.) tall by 4 in. (10 cm.) wide. Its pages
                        are unlined and unnumbered. A label in the upper left-hand corner of the paste-down endpaper inside the front
                        cover indicates that the notebook was "Sold by / Wm. W. Rose / Stationer. / 19 Wall St. N.Y."
                        The following text is scratched into the outside of the original front cover:
                        "S. Cox / Zanesville / Ohio / (U.S.A.)"
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        When acquired by the Ohio State University Libraries in 2005, Cox's
                        journal was in very delicate condition. Its leather
                        binding was cracked and peeled, the spine was missing, the stitching was so loose that the text block was in
                        danger of falling apart, and several leaves had become separated from their conjugates or completely loose.
                        Before the pages of the journal were scanned for this edition, the journal was disbound and the gatherings
                        repaired by Harry Campbell, Book and Paper Conservator with the Conservation Division of The Ohio State
                        University Libraries. Once scanning was complete, the volume was resewn and rebound. The original boards,
                        binding, and sewing supports were retained and are boxed with the restored journal.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        The state of the original volume makes complete description conjectural, but the following comparison
                        between the orginal and restored volumes will help users relate the page images contained in this
                        edition to the two states of the journal.
                     </p>

                        <emph rend="bold">Original</emph>. The front endpapers may have consisted of four leaves as follows: the paste-down 
                        endpaper, two conjugate leaves, and (conjecturally) a missing flyleaf or stub, all forming 
                        a separate section at the front. The text block proper was a straightforward 
                        16º: [A-H]10; 80 leaves. The back endpapers may have consisted of the paste-down endpaper 
                        and (conjecturally) a missing flyleaf or stub.

                        <emph rend="bold">Restored</emph>. The front endpapers consist of the original paste-down endpaper with the inside 
                        hinge area reinforced with sympathetic repair tissue. The text block is 
                        16º: [A]12 (+A1.2) [B-H]10; 82 leaves. The back endpapers consist of the original paste-down 
                        endpaper with the inside hinge area reinforced by sympathetic repair tissue.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        The journal is written mostly in brown ink on off-white paper that has taken on a bluish tint over time.
                        When at sea, Cox often wrote first in pencil, then at some later time traced over his text in ink,
                        perhaps to avoid spilling or smearing ink when the seas were rough. In most places where this overwriting 
                        occurs, it closely follows and all but obscures the penciled text. Where the texts diverge, the differences
                        typically consist of changes to line breaks or punctuation that do not alter meaning. Nevertheless,
                        in order to reflect this unique palimpsest-like character of the text, we encode passages consisting of both 
                        pencil and ink versions in which differences are legible<!-- with the following markings: [p&gt;] . . . [&lt;p] for 
                        pencil and [i&gt;] . . . [&lt;i] for ink-->. For those cases, a button in the right margin allows readers to toggle between the
                        two versions.

                     <p>Samuel Sullivan Cox (1824–1889) served as a Democratic congressman
                        in the United States House of Representative from 1856 until his death, save
                        for a few short interruptions, first representing his native Ohio (he was
                        born in Zanesville) and then, from 1868 onward, his adopted state of New
                        York. As a public servant, he is most remembered, even revered, for
                        strengthening the Life-Saving Service (a precursor to the Coast Guard) and
                        improving the working conditions of mail carriers. As a Democratic
                        politician, his legacy is marred by his oft-assumed role as spokesperson for
                        his party's resistance to abolition and emancipation during the years
                        leading up to the Civil War. As an author, Cox published articles and books
                        throughout his life on political and popular subjects, including six travel
                        books. But in May 1851, Cox was a twenty-six-year-old Brown University
                        graduate who had moved back to Ohio to practice law and had recently married
                        (Peskin). On May 7, he and his wife Julia (née Buckingham, whom he married
                        in October 1849), along with her brother Philo Buckingham and a cousin, Lucy Sturges, set sail
                        on a long-delayed honeymoon tour of Europe and the Orient (Linsey
                        204–205).
                     </p>
                     <p>The manuscript journal presented in this edition records Cox's experiences
                        and reflections during the trip, but it also serves as a sketch pad for an
                        expanded account of the voyage that Cox published the following year, <title level="m">A Buckeye abroad; or, Wanderings in Europe and in the
                        Orient</title> (1852). Appearing seventeen years before Mark Twain's more
                        famous debut as a travel writer, <title level="m">The Innocents Abroad; or,
                           The New Pilgrims Progress</title> (1869), <title level="m">A Buckeye
                           Abroad</title> is still far from the first account in English of a "grand
                        tour" of Europe. Both Twain and Cox offer similar <emph rend="italic">apologia</emph> for publishing yet another account of a grand tour. Twain presents
                        himself as everyman, rather than guide or critic:</p> <q rend="block">Yet
                           notwithstanding it is only a record of a picnic, it has a purpose, which
                           is to suggest to the reader how <emph rend="italic">he</emph> would be
                           likely to see Europe and the East if he looked at them with his own eyes
                           instead of the eyes of those who traveled in those countries before him.
                           (xvii)</q><p> Cox presents a similarly self-effacing ethos:</p> <q rend="block">The only merit reserved for a volume of travels is, either that the
                           ground is untrodden, or that the mode of observation is new and peculiar.
                           The author can lay no claim to the former. Something may be conceded to
                           him, from the fact imported by the title—<title level="m">A Buckeye Abroad</title>. A
                           native of the west, and of that part, familiarly known as the Buckeye
                           State,—may be supposed to look upon the scenes and mingle with
                           the throngs of the Old World with new and peculiar sensations, which may
                           find sympathy, if not with the general reader, at least with readers in
                           Ohio. (5)</q><p> Of course, the degree to which Cox (or Twain, for that
                        matter) presents "new and peculiar" views of Europe to his contemporaries is
                        open to interpretation. In Cox's notes about each stage of
                        his party's journey, however, twenty-first-century readers are sure to find
                        insights into an historical and cultural milieu removed in time and
                        sensibility from our own—even as we recognize long-enduring conventions of
                        travel and tourism as well as familiar dynamics of cross-cultural encounters. </p>

                        departure from Jersey City, NJ in the RMS <name type="ship">Asia</name> on
                        May 7, Cox conveys excitement, confidence, and eager anticipation. Still
                        within sight of land, he enthuses, they spotted a young whale: "Hurrah! He
                        spouted away throwing the spray 20 ft. high. No sensation of sickness yet.
                        All is <sic>exhileration</sic>." Not for long. On May 8th, he writes with
                        determination, "Sick to day, but able to be about. . . . I
                        had to keep on deck today—or give in." The next day his mood
                        turns: "Lay wretchedly all morning," he tells us, "Realized the horrors."
                        Then he falls silent until May 13, unable in the interim "to do anything
                        except lay sick." Cox's bout with sea-sickness was not the result of a
                        particularly weak stomach; rather, it reminds us of the rigors of the early
                        days of transatlantic passenger service on small steamships. The
                           <name type="ship">Asia</name>, the largest ship in the British and North
                        American Royal Mail Steam Packet Company's fleet when it was built the year
                        before Cox's trip, was a wooden-hulled sidewheeler, 266 feet long by 40 wide
                        with a gross tonnage of 2,226. By contrast, the current flagship of the
                        Cunard Line, the <name type="ship">Queen Mary 2</name>, is 1,132 feet long
                        by 135 feet wide abeam with an approximate gross tonnage of 151,400 (Cunard
                        Line). The ride, in short, was rough in any seas. These early pages of Cox's
                        journal also contain more subtle evidence of how violently the ship would
                        pitch and roll. While most of the journal is written in ink, the pages
                        composed at sea are written first in pencil, then traced over at some later
                        date in ink. Presumably, Cox didn't trust himself on the bounding main with
                        an open bottle of ink and a fountain pen!</p>
                     <p>In light of the discomfort he describes in ever more vivid prose (at one
                        point he laments that his sensibilities have been reduced to the
                        "nauseate sublime"), there is more than a little dramatic
                        irony in his fascination with the technology of sailing. "Was there
                        ever such perfection of enginery," he gushes at one point,
                        "so massive yet so perfect; so powerful so fit." Yet he
                        captures the public's fascination with the rapidly advancing technology of
                        steamship travel, particularly the competition between the British Cunard
                        Line and the American Collins Line during the 1850s to build ever bigger,
                        more powerful ships that would provide the fastest, most elegant
                        transatlantic crossing (Babcock 91–101). Cox provides a front-row
                        view of that international competition in his description of the <name type="ship">Asia's</name> encounter with the U.S. steamer <name type="ship">Humboldt</name> (not a Collins ship) and his speculation that the
                           <name type="ship">Asia</name> will beat the best crossing time of the
                        Collins steamer <name type="ship">Pacific</name>.</p>
                     <p>Cox's prose, as much as his subjects, characterize him as a writer
                        developing his distinctive voice. His writing—and
                        sensibilities—are clearly informed by his reading. In the space of a
                        single journal entry on May 13th, he quotes Washington Irving, Robert
                        Burton, William Wordsworth, Jonathan Sewall, and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. He
                        also draws on a rich—if sometimes overwrought—pictorial
                        imagination, an ability to sketch sentimental and often didactic tableaux in words.
                        Describing a small bird he sees somewhere off the coast of Nova Scotia or
                        Newfoundland, Cox writes,</p><q rend="block">How beautiful would be the song of
                           that little chorister upon a "bough swaying in the
                           breeze" in some sequestered nook amid a leafy valley surrounded
                           with green prospects &amp; smiling cultivation. How like a hymn to
                           its Creator would go up its carol to the All Audient creator;—yet here it
                           is, with fagged wing &amp; panting breast, contending with harsh cold
                           blasts, just able to overtop the snow spray of the mid Ocean,—deluded
                           from its home in the bosom of the wood by the mysteries of the Unknown, a
                           thing of song in a sea of chaos—soon to [be] whelmed forever! Is it not
                           an epitome of Man when he breaks the golden chords of that harmony which
                           binds him to his God!</q><p> Cox's skill at this sort of writing would earn
                        him the sobriquet "Sunset Cox" after the appearance in 1853 of an effusive
                        description of a sunset published in <title level="m">The Ohio
                        Statesman</title>, a political journal that he owned and edited in Columbus,
                        Ohio. Introducing a reprint of Cox's sunset essay in a 1910 volume of <title level="m">Ohio History</title>, E. O. Randall calls Cox a "master word
                        painter" (331). However, in his Preface to <title level="m">A Buckeye Abroad</title>,
                        Cox somewhat more modestly characterizes his literary allusions and
                        descriptive prose as spontaneous <foreign xml:lang="fre">plein air</foreign>
                        daguerreotypes of the scenes before
                        him:</p><q rend="block">The impressions herein recorded were mostly taken upon
                           the spot, and the allusions, historical, classical, or otherwise, were
                           not sought for, but sprung out of the time and locality. Each lineament
                           of each form in Nature or Art, each custom and characteristic were
                           daguerreotyped, though somewhat rapidly, if not imperfectly, from the
                           original, as it appeared in itself and in its environment. (6)</q> <p>While
                        it lies beyond the scope of this introduction to test Cox's claims, it is
                        worth noting here that the journal, from the early entries onward, provides
                        a rough means of gauging the spontaneity and directness of the writing in <title level="m">A Buckeye Abroad</title> and the degree to which it results from
                           revision and expansion.

                     <p>
                        As the <name type="ship">Asia</name> approaches Great Britain, Cox regains his sea legs and his appetite, 
                        finding the energy to explore the ship and even to appreciate, once again, the 
                        grandeur of the open ocean. Nevertheless, upon sight of the English coast, he enthuses, 
                        "And this is England! Glorious old England." 
                     </p>
                     <p rend="h3" xml:id="liverpool">Liverpool</p>
                        <p>Cox's entries from Liverpool convey contagious amazement: 
                        "How can I describe my feelings at the grand illumination?" Inevitably, his impressions are 
                        filtered through his reading and cultural biases: He first introduces us to the social scene 
                        of Liverpool by describing a street urchin as a "veritable O. Twist, who in his tatters and 
                        with a bow &amp; a touch of an <sic>apochryphal</sic> cap requested to carry the carpet bag."
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        With a storyteller's ear for dialogue, he transcribes the speech of colorful characters: 
                        "Soon came upon another liar. 'Waterloo Sir?' Sorry it's full Sir, I am boots there' Sir 
                        three ships just in hrs—Victoria Hotel is near—great hotel." With a travel writer's eye for 
                        landscape, architecture, and monuments, he provides a walking tour of Liverpool and its 
                        environs: "The Corinthian elegance of the architecture here &amp; the neatness &amp; well 
                        pavedness of the streets are permanent." And with a sketchbook artist's attention to detail, 
                        he occasionally draws a sketch in the margins of the journal.

                     <p rend="h3" xml:id="london">London</p>
                        <p>Arriving in London on 19 May, Cox spends his first full day, 
                        Tuesday, May 20th, visiting the famous Crystal Palace, which housed the Great Exhibition of 1851, 
                        to view its "splendid contents." Over the next three days, he and his companions 
                        take in the Crystal Palace, an opera, the Epsom Derby, and a host of other tourist sites. They 
                        even indulge in a bit of paparazzi-style rubbernecking at royalty, seizing a chance to chase 
                        down Queen Victoria while riding in a hansom cab: "I asked the driver if it was the Queen, he 
                        said Yes—'Drive after them!' Away went the sovereign of Gt B. Away after went us 
                        Sovereigns in chase. . . . we got pretty close. Whereupon to our open Eyes and outstretched 
                        necks, the Queen herself turned round &amp; gave us a good look &amp; full view."
                     </p>
                     <p>In addition to taking in the cultural sights—galleries, exhibitions, monuments, horse 
                        races, and royalty—this newly minted lawyer and future career politician makes a point 
                        of visiting the British Parliament. On May 23, he describes the (to his sensibilities 
                        chaotic) scene at the House of Commons and pastes into his journal a clipping from the 
                        <title level="m">Times</title> recounting a debate on the Ecclesiastical Titles Assumptions bill.
                     </p>
                     <p>Cox occasionally leavens his veneration of all things British with a pinch of Yankee pride, 
                        as he does when he declares the Princess Theatre at best only on par with the grandest theaters 
                        in the United States.
                     </p>
                     <p>The journal also reveals the quotidian trials and details of extended international travel in 
                        1851 (most of which still ring true today): Cox more than once loses track of the day and date, 
                        he repeatedly visits banks to deal with business back home or manage his funds (he stops by 
                        Barings bank in London), and he must regularly secure visas for upcoming legs of the journey.
                      </p>
                     <p rend="h3" xml:id="paris">Paris and Southern France</p>
                     <p>Cox arrives in Paris interested mainly 
                        in obtaining passports before moving on to Italy (or, more exactly, the various states that 
                        would comprise a united Italy after the 1860s and 70s), spending only one full day in the 
                        French capital, though a day he describes as "A perfect day of wonders." One special wonder 
                        turns out to be his own ability to speak French with his cabman: "My proficiency astonished 
                        me. Guess we can get along thro' France."</p>
                     <p>As the party heads south toward Italy and Rome, Cox takes particular note of the "Roman 
                        monuments in Gaul." Upon seeing a ruined viaduct in Avignon (probably the Pont du Gard) near 
                        which a proud new suspension bridge has been built, he exclaims, "How the old and new 
                        civilization is contrasted."

                     <p rend="h3" xml:id="sardinia">Sardinia and Tuscany</p>
                        <p>Traveling  from Marseilles to Genoa (Sardinia), 
                        Cox encounters—and describes—other travelers from the U.S., as he does 
                        occasionally during his travels. On board the <name type="ship">Languedoc</name>, he meets 
                        the author Ann Sophia Stephens, who is traveling with George and Julia Pratt, the children of 
                        Judge Zadoch Pratt of New York. Cox describes Mrs. Stephens somewhat cryptically as 
                        "caustically agreeable."
                     </p>
                     <p>Arriving in Leghorn (Tuscany) on June 4, Cox finds another reminder of home—the 
                        <name type="ship">U.S.S. Mississippi</name>—anchored in the port. On board the party 
                        meets the American sculptor Hiram Powers, most famous for his statue of the "Greek Slave" 
                        (1843), which was on display at the Great Exhibition. Significantly, given the political 
                        turmoil in Europe at this time, Cox's party will encounter several other U.S. warships 
                        during their travels, and Cox occasionally records discussions of politics with the locals.

                     <p rend="h3" xml:id="rome">"Eternal Rome" and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies</p>
                        <p>Upon his arrival 
                        at the port of Civita Veccia, Cox offers his "verdict re. Italians," contrasting the 
                        "higher classes," whom he finds "decent, polite &amp; refined," with the "lower classes," who 
                        "look hard, in dirty tatters, and with saucy deportment — <sic>mishaven</sic> 
                        and sallow—&amp; seemingly incapable of a noble thought." He laments that they represent 
                        "the degenerate scion of the old Roman tree!" This tendency to interpret the appearance and 
                        living conditions of the poor in terms of character is all too familiar, but it is 
                        especially troubling and ironic given Cox's attention to political oppression elsewhere 
                        (later in his travels, he rails against Ferdinand II, "the brutal despot of Naples").
                     </p>
                     <p>Rome, however, elicits Cox's veneration of Roman antiquities, which he describes with great 
                        detail in lengthy journal entries.

                     <p rend="h3" xml:id="orient">The "Dreamy Orient."</p>
                     <p>By contrast, Cox writes relatively little 
                        about Athens and Greece (and spends relatively little time there). En route to Constantinople 
                        via Smyrna, he describes islands nestled between the coasts of Greece and Turkey in the Aegean 
                        Sea: Tenedos, Lemnos, and Lesbos. After weaving through the Aegean, threading the Dardanelles, 
                        and steaming up the Bosphorus, the party finally arrives in the "Dreamy Orient."
                     </p>
                     <p>Accompanied by an American consul and local firman, Cox and his company explore mosques 
                        (including the Hagia Sophia), seraglios, harems, splendid flower and fruit gardens, 
                        fountains of goldfish, and the "richly ornamented" tomb of Sultan Mahmoud II.
                     </p>
                     <p>Stopping at Smyrna on their return, Cox and Philo take a traditional Turkish bath, and Cox 
                        records a sensuously detailed account of the process: "The attendant rubs us with glove hand 
                        with warm water, which is grateful &amp; good. He pours bowl on bowl over the entranced body 
                        until the frame almost <hi rend="underline">chills with delight</hi>. The head forms the point 
                        from which the dripping water falls all around. A soft &amp; pleasant sensation comes over 
                        the mind; not intense &amp; thrilling; but mellowed &amp; tender as a sunset would produce or 
                        a picture of Murillo. Soon P &amp; I began to throw the warm water at each other; in the mean 
                        time the sweat running, &amp; the sensation robbing the body of all save enjoyment."  
                        Not surprisingly, Cox omits most of this private description  from <title level="m">A 
                        Buckeye Abroad</title>.

                     <p>Cox's party returns to Italy at 
                        Trieste (at the time, part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire), then heads west to Venice, Verona, and 
                        Brescia on the way to Milan and Lake Como, crossing Venetzia and Lombardy. In Trieste, we 
                        are reminded again of the tumultuous history of mid-century Europe: "Germans &amp; 
                        Italians, Russian Soldiers &amp; Austrian, peasants &amp; merchants, all mingling in the 
                        shouts &amp; Joy of a Sunday night." At Verona, Cox again encounters Europe's nobility: 
                        "The train of the Elector of Saxony &amp; Queen started just before ours. He stopped at our 
                        Hotel, beat us at the Tower this morng, &amp; is in many respects an energetic fellow." 
                        Throughout these pages, though, Cox focuses on the stuff of travel writing: the people's 
                        dress and occupations, the landscape, architectural details, associations from literature 
                        and art. The party arrives in Lake Como on July 18, 1851. Cox has filled his journal and, 
                        before beginning a new volume, he takes a moment to reflect on his travels: "How much of the 
                        round Earth has been seen! What has it bought us? Humility, Charity Kindness &amp; Tenderness, 
                        No, these are plants, which grow in the shade of home, not the sun &amp; air of the World. 
                        It is to be hoped that the gentler virtues &amp; the primal duties will be better 
                        cultivated hereafter in our own homes." Unfortunately, we do not have the second journal, 
                        but we can follow the rest of the voyage in <title level="m">A Buckeye Abroad</title>.

            <p>This edition belongs to a series of collaboratively produced electronic editions of
               previously unpublished nineteenth-century American manuscripts held in the Rare Books
               and Manuscripts Library (RBMS) at The Ohio State University Libraries. Other editions
               include "Selected Entries from the Lucius Clark Smith Diaries,
               30 July 1862 to 31 December 1862"; "My Dear Elizabeth," five letters written by Sophia Peabody Hawthorne to her
               sister Elizabeth Palmer Peabody between ca. 1837 and 1868; and Louisa A. Doane's "Journal
               of Two Ocean Voyages (1852-1853)."</p>
            
            <p>Each text was initially edited in connection with an undergraduate or graduate course
               on electronic textual editing offered by H. Lewis Ulman, Associate Professor of
               English at The Ohio State University. The courses provided students with an
               opportunity to explore issues of textuality and mediation that arise when our
               cultural archives spread from page to screen and from library shelves to networked
               databases. Electronic textual editing served as each class's context for examining
               what happens—and envisioning what might happen—when artifacts in one medium are
               represented in another medium, especially with regard to the interpretive work of
               reading. Electronic textual editions also provided a contact zone that helped
               students reflect on what manuscript, print, and "born digital" artifacts can tell us
               about their unique properties and their relationships to one another.</p>
            
            <p>While the students' work focused on providing reliable textual editions, they also
               explored four threads inextricably woven into the work of electronic textual editing:
               the lives and historical milieu evoked by the texts; the history, characteristics,
               and preservation of physical and digital texts; the editorial processes and decisions
               that shape particular interpretations and presentations texts; and the mediation of
               electronic delivery systems.</p>
            
            <p>These conceptual focuses, along with the time constraints of academic terms and the
               need to train students who had, typically, no prior experience in textual editing or
               the various technologies employed in electronic textual editing, strongly influenced
               the selection of texts in this series. Working with curators in the RBMS, Professor
               Ulman identified previously unpublished manuscript materials that were of potentially
               broad interest and that reflected a curatorial focus of the RBMS collection—for
               example, letters and personal diaries that connect private lives with larger
               historical contexts. Focusing on unique manuscript materials not, in all but one
               case, associated with other copies or later published versions also eliminated the
               need to compare multiple copies or states of the same work, perhaps held in other
               archives, an impractical task in the course of an academic term. Other practical
               matters also informed the choice of materials, including the possibility of scanning
               the source documents before the class so that students could work with both the
               original documents and high-resolutions facsimiles as they transcribed and encoded
               the source texts.</p>
            
            <p>Thus, the editions in this series are documentary editions—interpretations and
               representations of single documents—designed to provide wider exposure and access to
               manuscript materials that might otherwise be overlooked, and to provide users with a
               variety of tools for studying those texts.</p>
            
            <p>While providing a reliable textual edition is a <foreign xml:lang="lat"><hi

               explores ways of telling four stories inextricably woven into our work: the lives and
               historical milieu evoked by the texts, the history of the physical documents, the
               editorial process that gave rise to this particular interpretation of the texts, and the
               mediation of our electronic delivery system. </p>
            
            <p> Over the course of several years following the classes in which students worked on
               the editions, Professor Ulman revised the introductory materials to ensure stylistic
               consistency and proofed the transcription and encoding. He also redesigned the
               structure of the editions to meet the requirements of Ohio State's institutional
               repository, evolving accessibility standards, and feedback from peer reviewers.
               However, he did not undertake a complete retranscription of the source text or
               revision of the students' introductory essays and annotations.</p>

               at 400 dots per inch (dpi), then coverted to 8-bit JPEG images at 400 dpi and full
               quality. All edges were overscanned by at least 1/4 inch. No color correction was used at any stage of image
               preparation, but a scan of a photographer's 18% grey card on the same scanner
               produced RGB values at the center of 91/95/107 after applying a 150% Gaussian Blur in
               Adobe Photoshop to average color values. Thus, a properly configured monitor should

               the line or in the margins, capitalization, line breaks, and page breaks 
               have all been transcribed and encoded as they appear in the original manuscripts. The
               representation of those features varies depending on the view of the letter. An explanation of 
               the presentation in each view of the letters can be read via the "About this View" link

               This editorial introduction and the three "views" of the letters were generated from the main XML file
               using XSL transformations to produce HTML Web pages. Several of the appendices were encoded in HTML separately.
               A more detailed description of the markup can be found via the "Appendices" menu, and all source files

               represented in the markup. Each entry contains an &lt;opener&gt;

               values: city, region; and a &lt;date&gt; element with a
               "value" attribute whose value is in the form YYYY-MM-DD.</p>
            <p>Entries consist of a series of <emph rend="bold">paragraphs</emph>. Where
               indicated by indentation of a line from the left margin of a page, line breaks

               manuscript features (e.g., cancellations, interlinear or marginal additions, tears in
               pages) are encoded, as are regularized versions of proper names and dates and
               standard versions of nonstandard spellings and expansions of abbreviations. In several
               instances in which the ink copy differs from the underlying penciled text,

               declaration at the beginning of the core TEI XML-compliant transcript of Cox's
               journal (SSCoxJournal.xml) facilitate inclusion of external digital files. The "mmid"
               attribute added to the &lt;pb&gt; element identifies the unique item

                     sections written in pencil, sections written in ink, and sections in which text
                     written originally in pencil is overwritten (and, in a very few cases, altered)
                     in ink. Based on the headings and content of the journal entries, we assume
                     that the original text of Cox's journal was written in pencil when he was
                     onboard a ship at sea (perhaps to avoid spilling ink) and in ink when he was on
                     land or on a ship lying at anchor. The penciled passages overwritten in ink
                     were presumably composed at sea and overwritten later, perhaps to create a copy
                     less prone to fading. Because the pencil and superimposed ink copies of
                     passages vary so little, only differences between the pencil and ink text have been encoded, and we
                     provide a button allowing readers to display each version.</note>

               of the Gulf Stream, and curve their channel into a horse-shoe. . . . This 'bend' is the great receptacle of

               <lb/> The tunnel out of Liverpool, is 1 1/4
               <lb/> mile, through the solid rock. We
               <lb/> moved over an inclined plane; by force
               <lb/> of a stationary engine. As soon as
               <lb/> we emerged, into the open air, every

               <lb/> nicely carpeted meadows.— We are
               <lb/> now moving away, still in sight of
               <lb/> a beautiful tower upon the hill at
               <lb/> our left. The peculiar chimneys &amp;
               <lb/> the very red bricks of the houses, give
               <lb/> <placeName>Stafford</placeName> an air of rural comfort, only
               <lb/> equalled by every other part of this mag<seg type="softhyphen">
               <lb/></seg>nificent country. Nature seems as
               <lb/> if just washed in a shower, and so
               <lb/> bright, almost yellow in the green that
               <lb/> it pleases the eye strangely. The
               <lb/> churches, are mostly Gothic, and
               <lb/> peeping from amid the clump of
               <lb/> leafiness. I no longer wonder at the
               <lb/> love of rural life, the love of gardens
               <lb/> and meadows and walks &amp; woods, &amp;
               <lb/> parterres &amp; terraces, so often the subject
               <lb/> of the English pastoral. The meads were
               <lb/> literally embroidered with butter cups, so
               <lb/> yellow, &amp; daisies so white; while all along
               <lb/> our way we were lined with the hawthorn
               <lb/> hedges. Oh! those exquisite hedges, so
               <lb/> neat &amp; trim, &amp; green; parting neat fields

               <lb/> from their sister meads,—fields dotted with
               <lb/> the unwanted saffron furze, and silvered
               <lb/> along with little streams, to the very
               <lb/> edge of which the carpets of grass
               <lb/> extended. The hills were dotted all
               <lb/> over with the purest fleeces of
               <lb/> South downs; and the plains were
               <lb/> all spotted with the spotted Durham
               <lb/> cattle. Perfect pictures of pastoral
               <lb/> repose! Some of the fields were blue as
               <lb/> the sky with pansies. The cottages, how
               <lb/> many of them, were all ivied over, except
               <lb/> the high thatched roofs of slate or straw.
               <lb/> The land was of a reddish tinge, until
               <lb/> as we approached <placeName type="city"/>London,—near <placeName>Layton</placeName>,
               <lb/> a chalk formation appeared. Our agri<seg type="softhyphen">-

               <lb/> dumb at what Art had done for
               <lb/> Nature here so naturally sterile.
               <lb/> The common roads were all bound in with
               <lb/> with the green hedge &amp; seemed as
               <lb/> smooth as winding garden paths. In<seg type="softhyphen">-
               <lb/></seg>deed the whole sweep of the country,
               <lb/> is one vast panorama of gardens.
               <lb/> The fields are deeply furrowed—those
               <lb/> for grain &amp; with such exactitude as
               <lb/> give the appearance of taste and
               <lb/> heed to Every part! Nature seems 
               <lb/> as if swept by the care of her child<seg type="softhyphen">-
               <lb/></seg>ren. Not a sign of poverty. The
            
           <!-- Proofed 20080624 by HLU/ED -->

               <lb/> manufacturing districts all seemed so
               <lb/> neat—Then long high chimney stacks
               <lb/> lifting themselves out of the level
               <lb/> land and at their top, tipped
               <lb/> with wavy streamers of smoke.
               <lb/> Yet even about the manufactories
               <lb/> is this same rural love. Each
               <lb/> railway station is a little Paradise
               <lb/> of Beauty. Grounds laid off so reg<seg type="softhyphen">-
               <lb/></seg>ularly. There does not seem to be a
               <lb/> <hi rend="underline">sloven</hi> in all the land. Poverty as
               <lb/> I said, does not appear. Agriculture
               <lb/> is certainly not depressed here, for
               <lb/> every inch of land is taken. If 4
               <lb/> times as much is imported as
               <lb/> formerly &amp; consumed, &amp; they raise
               <lb/> more than they used to, has not
               <lb/> the Free Trade theory Done much!
            </p>
            <p>
               <lb/> The most noticeable object was
               <lb/> a fine Old Tower, upon a hill of
               <lb/> trees to the right. It commands
               <lb/> a prospect of the country, &amp; has that
               <lb/> imposing air which an old castle
               <lb/> should have.

               <lb/> Altogether we were gloriously ani<seg type="softhyphen">-

               <lb/> our minds passed so many

               <lb/> out for an example of the best."
               <lb/> Soon I descried the valley of the

                  <lb/> All of us were so agreeably disappointed.
                  <lb/> The arrangement was only equalled by

               <lb/> into the ball. It is 9 ft diameter, looks

               <lb/> Didn't stay long; the sense of being

               <lb/> We are now lying at the head of Sicily in
               <lb/> <choice><sic>Massena</sic><corr>Messina</corr></choice> harbor, having arrived here
               <lb/> at 8 AM. We left Naples at 1, &amp; was
               <lb/> long in losing sight of her beautiful bay. All
               <lb/> went below to sleep, while I alone stayed
               <lb/> upon deck to see Capri. We passed between
               <lb/> Capri &amp; the Point Campanelli; leaving Sorrento
               <lb/> &amp; Castel a Mare behind, &amp; Vesuvius hid from
               <lb/> our view forever. The isle looked bleak and
               <lb/> rocky near by, as it did in the distance.
            </p>
            <p>
               <lb/> On the seaward side, I saw the arch in
               <lb/> the sea through which the waves of light
               <lb/> &amp; water rolled. The Appenines range close
               <lb/> to the shore: high pallisades rising 3000 ft
               <lb/> or more perpendicularly from the sea, guarded
               <lb/> the coast. The rocks were covered with a
               <lb/> sort of yellow lichen; now &amp; then were
               <lb/> spots of cultivation. We gradually diverged
               <lb/> from shore, leaving the gulf of Salerno
               <lb/> behind us, until we reached <choice><sic>Port</sic><corr>Point</corr></choice> Pali<seg type="softhyphen">-

               <lb/> sun round &amp; golden roll down his disk
               <lb/> into the waves. The waves were lit into
               <lb/> blazing beauty by his fire; a long line of
               <lb/> flashing gold, gradually dying into the
               <lb/> richest purple. The spray near our 
               <lb/> boat was royal in its color as the robes
               <lb/> of the Caesar. A canopy of cloud impur<seg type="softhyphen">-

               <lb/> We are aboard the French War steamer
               <lb/> Sesostris, for Malta. A few passengers
               <lb/> speak English. The accommodations are
               <lb/> good. This morn I awoke up &amp; hurried
               <lb/> on deck to see M<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> Etna, whose snowy top
               <lb/> was just observable above the highlands
               <lb/> of the N.E. part of Sicily. We had passed
               <lb/> the gulfs which form the <hi rend="underline">instep</hi> of the boot
               <lb/> of the Italian peninsula in the night, &amp;
               <lb/> were now in the gulf of Gioja, approaching

               <lb/> miles from <choice><sic>Massena</sic><corr>Messina</corr></choice>. Where the dogs of
               <lb/> Homer barked in the cavernous wave
               <lb/> washed rocks, we saw but slight ripples.
               <lb/> The tide was not such as to make it
               <lb/> dangerous. The waves glistened blue &amp; bright,
               <lb/> Oh! how clearly, transparently blue! The
               <lb/> sailors had just washed the decks &amp; were
               <lb/> busy washing &amp; burnishing the metalic
               <lb/> portions of the deck: The whistle of the
               <lb/> boatswain &amp; the bustle of the <del type="unrecoverable" rend="overwritten">sailors</del>, the
               <lb/> cries of the officers to the pilot announces
               <lb/> that some precaution is still necessary
               <lb/> even with steam, at this point of classic
               <lb/> terror. Our boat moves on; but no opening
               <lb/> appears for it. All is rock bound, save
               <lb/> a sand bar &amp; a fret. Soon we discern

               <lb/> <persName>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Winthrop</persName>, our Consul; got in<seg type="softhyphen">-

            <p>
               <lb/> The tombs of the monkish soldiers are
               <lb/> very curious. We visited the crypt below
               <lb/> the Cathedral. The Church was covered 
               <lb/> with green orange leaves, as yesterday
               <lb/> was the festal day of S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> John. This isle
               <lb/> was given to the Order, after they were
               <lb/> driven out of <placeName type="region">Palestine</placeName>, by

               <lb/></seg>lic works. Six different languages were

               <lb/> We also visited the Armory, which has

               <lb/> of some of the Grand Masters curiously

               <lb/> of the earlier eras; Turkish arms taken
               <lb/> by the Knights are here also. <persName>Walter Scott</persName>       
               <lb/> would like to have been here.
            </p>
            <p>
               <lb/> The streets of Malta glistened with a
               <lb/> painful dazzle. The houses are of white
               <lb/> stone. Cleanliness is apparent. But such
               <lb/> a pest of beggary never beset humanity,
               <lb/> as beset us, when we sallied out of our
               <lb/> Hotel to the steamer. I carried a club,
               <lb/> &amp; had to beat them off almost.
            </p>
            <p>
               <lb/> We entered the sides of the French War
               <lb/> steamer <name type="ship">Egyptus</name> for <placeName>Athens</placeName>. Just before
               <lb/> we left, Music was heard below in
               <lb/> a boat, 4 fellows smoking &amp; fiddling.
               <lb/> Not a cent did they get. On the<supplied reason="omitted" resp="#ed">y</supplied> sawed;
               <lb/> &amp; on they rowed. Our mate began giving
               <lb/> orders to get under way. Still they
               <lb/> fiddled--"<foreign xml:lang="fre">Abord</foreign>!" tutytuty twang!
               <lb/> "Sacre <unclear/>!" Soon <sic>were</sic> were under

               <lb/> which the Knights built to make
               <lb/> Malta, the strongest place in the world.
               <lb/> The involutions of stone walls, over
               <lb/> which red coats are peeping, seems
               <lb/> impregnable. Soon we pass in the
               <lb/> open sea, which tosses high &amp; rough.
               <lb/> Eight or ten ships, lay like long shadows
               <lb/> in the distant offing, spectral &amp; dim.
               <lb/> It was the English fleet, returning to

               <lb/> To day, we arrived about 10 AM
               <lb/> at the Pireus. Emotions better felt
               <lb/> than told, welcomed our approach to
               <lb/> the land of philosophy &amp; song.  We ar<seg type="softhyphen">-

               <lb/> with glory. The houses looked low, of

               <lb/> It is a rough &amp; rugged ascent from
               <lb/> the Bema. Though on the East its

               <lb/> Paul's auditory to have been on
               <lb/> the steps; but no — it must have
               <lb/> been on the top, just where I read
               <lb/> his speech to the party. We next

               <lb/> Two camels? Since writing the foregoing,
               <lb/> if we have seen two, we have see over
               <lb/> an hundred. We had to dodge them
               <lb/> in the long, carriageless, donkeyful streets.
               <lb/> These with the men form the principal
               <lb/> beasts of burden. Men with long poles car<seg type="softhyphen">-

               <lb/> a little doubtful; he kept a string of Jews follow<seg type="softhyphen">-
               <lb/></seg>ing &amp; dodging us at the corners. They grew as
               <lb/> we progressed. My patience did not fail to
               <lb/> suggest a last resort — after vain efforts before,
               <lb/> in the shape of janissaries. It made the

               <lb/> bye," sung out that blackeyed rascal of a
               <lb/> Greek, in mockery of my own goodbye taunt.
               <lb/> We went through bazaars after bazaars —
               <lb/> great deep dark, ugly shops ranged under
               <lb/> overarching sheds, in front of which on plat<seg type="softhyphen">=

               <lb/> big turbaned Turks, in indolent dignity
               <lb/> Jews are in their own quarters; the big

               <lb/> power &amp; strength. Poor dogs lie around —
               <lb/> a foretaste of Constantinople. The
               <lb/> crescent &amp; the star guards the Entrance
               <lb/> to our resort. The hair of the women who
               <lb/> surround us (Jews) hangs long &amp; inter<seg type="softhyphen">-

               <lb/> man sitting cross legged on a donkey.
               <lb/> Black slaves are seen turbaned to
               <lb/> death; moving in indolent state.
               <lb/> 5 quartered sheep were here seen —
               <lb/> What Singular tails! Bass wood
               <lb/> grew about us. The air was soft &amp;

               <lb/> The other costumes were very gorgeous.
               <lb/> Soon we were aboard; and in fair

              <lb/> left Liverpool. What an an
              <lb/> era in our lives has <del type="unrecoverable" rend="overwritten">this</del> period
              <lb/> been. How much of the round
              <lb/> Earth has been seen! What has
              <lb/> it bought us? Humility, Charity

              <lb/> the shade of home, not the sun

              <lb/> the primal duties will be better
              <lb/> cultivated hereafter in our own
              <lb/> homes. We have thus far, Julia &amp;
              <lb/> myself spent about $1000,—which
              <lb/> includes all our purchases. We
              <lb/> have been free in our expenditure.
              <lb/> I prize most our paintings at
